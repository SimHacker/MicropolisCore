This page is Don Hopkins's accepted Interactive Experience proposal for
demonstrating cooperative multiplayer SimCity (SimCityNet) at INTERCHI '93
in Amsterdam. The conference theme was bridges between worlds; the proposal
riffs on that with "bridges between players," "bridges between dijks," and
"bridges between brands." Body text below is faithful to the published HTML
(light headings added only for readability).

SimCityNet is an animated interactive system simulation game, providing a
set of rules and tools for planning and building a complex dynamic
simulated city. Several people on different workstations can participate
in the same game, cooperating and coordinating their actions over the net.

Working together, you can zone land use, hook up the power grid, build
roads, bridges, parks and stadiums, raise taxes, and even summon disasters,
causing the city to grow and thrive, or crumble and die. SimCityNet
features multiple city views and maps with overlays, simultaneous editing
and user interface interaction, "voting panels" for group decision making,
and multimedia communication and annotation features ("bridges between
players").

## Multi-user communication

The multi user interface supports communication via three media in
parallel: text, sound, and graphics. It includes a scrolling text log for
telegram messages, a networked audio server for sound effects and voice
intercom, and shared cursors and graphical overlays for pointing,
gesturing, annotating and editing the map.

## Interactive experience proposal (Amsterdam)

I propose to build a model of the Amsterdam neighborhood near the
conference ("bridges between dijks"), and let people walk up and interact
as they please. Experienced SimCityNet players can participate, using the
shared environment and communication features to demonstrate the system,
advise other players, and coordinate the game.

The purpose of the experience is to create a constructive cooperative
virtual environment, where people can collaborate towards a common goal,
take part in group decisions, and share resources, responsibility, and the
consequences of each others actions.

SimCityNet is robust and easy to use, with engaging interactive sound
effects and lively graphical animation, so it's fun to watch as well as
play.

## Platforms ("bridges between brands")

SimCityNet can be played across several different makes of computer at once
("bridges between brands"). It presently runs on color SPARC and Indigo
workstations (and is easily portable to other Unix platforms), and plays
over the net (but without sound) on other 8 bit color X terminals and
workstations. I can ship my own SPARC if necessary, and I'm trying to
obtain support and a loan of equipment (hopefully Indigos) in Holland.

## Venue needs

It would be useful to have a high resolution video projector, visible from
the other workstations. The projector could display overall city maps,
graphs, messages, statistics and other global data, so players don't need
to spend their own screen space.

I need enough floor and table space to place workstations where people can
walk up to them and use the keyboard, mouse, and microphone. Most could be
together in a group within view of the video projector, but others could
be in remote locations.

The workstations, network, video projector, and posters must be set up and
torn down, but none of that's very difficult. Thin wire ethernet would be
preferable, and would require thick to thin transceiver for the
workstations equipped with thick wire ethernet plugs.

Once SimCityNet is set up and running, it doesn't require special
supervision. I will attend and demonstrate the system as much as I can, but
during other times, unless someone volunteers, it can run on its own, as
long as there's enough security that none of the equipment walks off.

## Implementation status

I'm presently implementing SimCityNet on X11 for DUX Software (who licensed
SimCity from Maxis). It's mostly functional now, and will be ready to
demonstrate, but not yet released as a product, by the time of the
conference. Soon I'll have an "Alpha" demo version for the SGI and SPARC,
for limited distribution to INTERCHI reviewers and other interested people.
I'll make a video tape as soon as I have the time and equipment.

## Background

I've given many talks and interactive presentations at conferences, and run
demos at trade show booths. At CHI'90, I participated in the "Empowered"
performance (giving a whirlwind tour of pie menu based user interfaces I'd
implemented). Last year, I ported SimCity (single user) to OpenWindows on
the SPARC (which won "Product of the Year 1992" from Unix World). I worked
as a developer of The NeWS Toolkit (at Sun in Mountain View) and the
HyperLook UIMS (at the Turing Institute in Glasgow), both of which I used
to port SimCity to the SPARC. To implement SimCityNet on X11, I'm using the
Tk toolkit, which I chose to use because it's free, simple, and extensible.
