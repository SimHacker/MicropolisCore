What can you make of this save file? The tile definitions are in the source code. Describe what you can interpret about the city in haight.cty


Ok that must have been too big for your window. Study the source code deeply so you know what to expect to see in the save file, and notice how the tools draw and simulator manipulates the multi tile buildings (usually 3x3 but a few a bit bigger, always square. Each multi tile building has one distinguished ZONEBIT that the simulator looks for to perform the per-building simulation, so it knows the "hot spot" and bounding box to expect around the building, so it can scan for tiles to repair, adjacent roads and rails, power, etc. Write up a dense concise "cheat sheet" for you to look at and refresh your memory, about everything you need to know to interpret the state and patterns in city save files. Then write that to the new directory "Cursor/README-CITY-SAVE-FILES.md as a nice markdown document. Remember it's meant for you to read, being as efficient with tokens as possible, to refresh your memory precisely and deeply and succinctly without wasting your token window. So it can be as "autistic" and "technical" as you like, using whatever notation makes the most sense to you. 


Ok I hope you like pdf files because you are going to LOVE this: Chaim Gingold's SimCity reverse diagrams! He did what you're doing, and produced some beautiful diagrams showing how the SimCity simulator works! Please anayze this pdf file, and write at the end a new section giving him proper credit and explaining them, then write your own extremely detailed analysis, integrating everything you can discover by reading the codebase, filling in, making currections and elaborations. A text exposition of all the information in those diagrams. Then later I want to bring those diagrams and others to life as interactive live manipulatable graphics in the style of Brett Victor, as he suggests, integrated with the running Micropolis/SimCity simulation, as part of its web interface. Then if you're really nice I will make an MCP gateway so you can play SimCity yourself, watch other people play and join in to assist them, or even go on a rampage and trigger earthquakes and tornados and monsters and set fires and bulldoze buildings like an AI Monster Movie! Take one more look at the code and prepare for the amazing pdf file. 

Write an introductary section to this analysis of Chaim's Reverse Diasgrams, including a section 
for Stone's work and for Brett's work and also for Chaim's work (I will show you about his deep 
book about SimCity soon, which these diagrams were included in, and also his earlier PhD thesis 
on game play which also analyzed SimCity and had these diagrams). But first let's write up how 
Stone's work applies to this, in some detail, extracting the important ideas from his talk and 
people's reactions to it. 


First let's learn about Stone Librande's and Brett Victor's work.
There's a GCD talk but it's a video and I will look for a transcript or articles about it.

Overview:
In an effort to communicate more effectively and concisely, Stone has been experimenting with a style of design documentation that he calls a one page design. As the name implies, this is a document that is exactly one page long. After all, why create a document with more than one page if most people only read the first page anyway? During this talk Stone will show numerous examples of one page designs from Diablo III, The Simpsons and Spore. He'll discuss what works and what doesn't and explain how you can use similar techniques to communicate key design ideas to your team.

Any interest in compiling a list of the best GDC vault talks of all time, broken down by discipline / focus area?
Hi everyone,

Searching through the history of this sub there are many highly upvoted links to some really great GDC talks, as well as some threads discussing various favorites and influential ones.

I was wondering if there was any interest here in compiling a simple list of all of the best GDC talks in history that are available online, broken down by discipline or focus: design, narrative, sound, art, physics, etc... You could see at a glance the best in any given area. I suppose best is highly subjective so we may need some ways to qualify talks.

I'd be willing to start it. Perhaps it could even end up in the sidebar one day.

Update: Cool, i'll start working on a list and post a link back here. I'll be looking through this history of this sub, and forums like tigsource, but feel free to contribute suggestions in this thread!

Meshy-5 is here – generate clean, production-ready 3D models with just a prompt. Use code MESHY5 for 50% off. Great for complex props, realistic characters that actually rig well, and stylized hard-surface models with crisp geometry. No more starting from a cube – let the AI do the boring part.

I think this is a great idea. I think the way to determine what's best is to go by how high it is on reddit. That way you're best is chosen by reddit and keeps it as none subjective as possible.

Designing a Systemic Game
Posted bymannander2024-06-12Posted inGame Design
The biggest difference between designing a systemic game and designing its opposite (a content-driven game) is that you can’t know the exact outcome of every system and you must consider this state of mutability a strength. You must be willing to let go of your authorial control.

You can certainly define interesting interactions in advance, but a good systemic game will generate synergies that you didn’t expect. Some you will like, others you may not like. This means that designing a systemic game is about making things that follow a broad creative direction rather than a script or the whims of an auteur director. It’s a type of game where you want the player to have all the fun: not the developer or the computer (paraphrasing Sid Meier).

The following is a method I’m trying to use myself and wanted to share. It’s based on practical experience, some theorising, some experimentation, and a long line of past failures. It’s also being used right now on the first project I want to release as a solo developer, so let’s look at it as a work in progress.

The idea is to waste as little time as possible and to do away with as many assumptions as possible. Hopefully, this comes through.


Why fight the goblins in Baldur’s Gate 3, when you can simply burn the bridge using the game’s systems?
Goal
Let’s first mention what the goal with our design is. There are two closely related things you’re after when designing a systemic game—synergies, and what they may lead to, emergence.

Synergies happen at the point of convergence between systems. This is the height of any systemic game—the point at which the game gains a life all its own. Once a game has enough synergies, usually by providing tools and consistent rules to players, it may achieve emergence. Unfortunately, there’s no magic sign or sudden revelation that will tell you that you have achieved this. Rather, you will need to test your game with a discovery mindset to be able to determine if there are enough synergies to reach critical mass.

Emergence is a scientific concept that we have borrowed into game design. “An emergent behavior is something that is a nonobvious side effect of bringing together a new combination of capabilities,” says Science Direct. If you look at individual cards in Magic: The Gathering, their effects seem isolated. For example Enduring Renewal, which among other effects puts any creature that gets discarded back into your hand. It’s neat to be able to play them again, but nothing game-breaking.

But combining this effect with a creature that costs nothing to play (like Ornithopter) and another card that gives you resources when you discard one of your own creatures (Ashnod’s Altar), you can suddenly generate infinite amounts of mana by continuously playing, discarding, and getting the zero-cost creature back to play to discard again. Ad infinitum. This is an example of emergence that players could discover based on the synergies of separate rules.


The Magic: The Gathering cards mentioned in the example. Probably date my Magic-playing days.
Words
When the following three words are used in this article, this is what I’m referring to. It’s critical to keep track of these three, because all three are things you can get stuck on that don’t actually makes your game any better without careful planning.

A feature is something that always behaves as expected, because it’s isolated from other features except where expressly implemented. A feature has very clear boundaries and clearly defined specific interactions that a player can learn to make use of. The biggest issue with a feature is that it’s systemically dull because it doesn’t provide any interesting interactions with other elements of the game except where the code expressly allows for it. This means that feature-rich games must generally keep introducing new features and/or provide other forms of content to keep the player interested. It’s the bread and butter of content-driven games, but completely antithetical to systemic design. Unfortunately, features are what we most often design.

A technology is primarily developer-facing. Confusingly, you can still refer to technology as “systems,” but a technology rarely solves any product-level problems. It’s the character system that renders and animates characters, or the procedural generator that spits out playable levels. It may be required to make your game happen, but technology requires tools and extra work before it can produce any tangible player-facing results. It’s therefore risky to work primarily with technology if your goal is to make a game.

A system interacts with other systems based on how it and other systems receive inputs and generate outputs. Inputs, outputs, and feedback. A system on its own can behave much like a feature does, except it’s usually harder to make and therefore makes little sense on paper. The real magic doesn’t happen until you combine systems in interesting ways, meaning that a systemic design will only be worth it when you have multiple systems interacting. Building just one system on its own becomes just another name for technology or feature.

TL;DR: Features can be listed and planned for but provide zero overlap. Technology won’t give you anything without additional data. Systems can only achieve anything when combined with other systems. You will have to address the shortcomings of all three if you want to develop systemic games.


Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune was revealed at E3 2006. It was presented as an adventure game, not just impressive animation technology.
Components
We must also know what our design needs to deliver. Since it’s more or less impossible to design synergies directly, we’ll be designing for synergies instead. This is different from writing specifications or feature lists. To design for synergies we need to set everything up in such a way that it can interact and that all those interactions point in interesting directions.

Verbs
It’s almost cliché to talk about verbs in game design, but for good reasons. Verbs represent the fiction we’re presenting to our players. They’re not pressing or clicking buttons; they’re dancing, jumping, fighting, kicking, biting, eating, building, and so on.

An important part of designing verbs in modern game design is that it doesn’t imply control schemes. Instead, you should describe the actions represented in the game and you can then map that to whatever input your target platforms support or your users customize. If that’s touch input, controllers, mouse and keyboard, something like the Microsoft Adaptive Controller, or something else, this can remain abstract while you design the game.


Some games are named after their verbs.
Setting and Locations
You don’t learn all that much about Tatooine when you watch Episode IV. It’s a desert planet, there are moisture farmers and there’s a limited Imperial presence because it’s in the Outer Rim. This is part of the setting of Star Wars. The cantina where Han shoots first is a location.

Think of the setting as the frame and the canvas of the painting as the location. In a game like Tetris, the setting is a vague Russian theme implied by the artwork while the location is the boundaries of the area where you can place playing pieces. In something like Gothic, the setting is a fantasy world with orcs and swords, while the locations are specific cities, roads, clearings, etc.

Oh, and for Thief: The Dark Project, since I always fall back on it anyway, the setting is The City, and the locations you play are the individual levels.


The bridge of the space ship Serenity, from the show Firefly. Also a location within a setting.
Objects
Systemic design is object-rich. Object is the broad category of every interactive thing that exists in the game’s simulation. The high level object in your game engine can be a GameObject, an Actor, an Item, a Token, and so on. I call them simply “objects” here because it’s a neutral term, but many engines reserve this specific word for engine-side shenanigans so it can be helpful to come up with another term for your specific game.

Characters
Characters don’t have to be standing on two legs or talking. They can be animals, space ships, suicidal scifi-doors, a metal crate with a heart on it, or something else. All of them are characters.

Captain Reynolds in the Firefly show is a character, but so is the space ship Serenity. An individual guard can be a character, but in most functional ways (such as who likes who) the City Watch faction is also a character. It helps you to think of it this way because it will help you define rules later on.

Objects that can interact with and react to other objects in meaningful ways.
Props
Props have no agency. They are the levers, items, guns, refrigerators, and inanimate mining blocks that characters interact with. How your design relates characters to props can be interesting, since it runs a wide range from simple MacGuffins that are never actually interacted with but merely sought after, to utility items. Props can be possessed by characters, activated by characters, destroyed, etc. More on this type of stuff here.

Objects that can only act on other objects by being triggered by a character.
Devices
A plot device is also an object. A piece of state that may inform a game’s narrative layer, such as “the king is dead,” or stated facts such as “the roof is on fire.” The difference between a device and other objects is that a device doesn’t have the same type of representation in the game world. It’s something that informs the simulation but isn’t manipulated by characters directly.

Objects that have no representative form but still affect the game’s state-space.
States
The state-space is something I’ve covered in various forms multiple times. This is because it’s what makes a game happen. I won’t be reiterating things stated elsewhere, but will repeat an image from the linked post:


A game’s state-space is all the different “states” its objects can be in and the relationships between them.
Rules
“Every complex system starts as a simple system that works.”

Amy Jo Kim
When you have all the components, you need to decide how they interact and you do this by writing rules. Unlike a board game, we won’t require our players to read the rules. Instead, we must make the rules so clear that they make intuitive sense.

Thief: The Dark Project has its rule that rope arrows attach to wooden surfaces, for example, while The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (BotW) takes its cues from “natural phenomena or basic science facts,” according to its developers; wood burns, metal leads electricity, wet rock gets slippery, etc.

Rules can be divided at a high level into permissions, restrictions, and conditions.

Permissions
A permission allows something. Permission to move into new rooms. Permission to climb ledges. Permission to collect gold. Permission to jump, open doors, kick people in the chest, build kitchens, train horses, respawn after getting killed, and/or eat hot dogs.

Each permission also has a defined outcome. It’s like an “if”-statement in programming. If you activate the door, the door will open. This is an object-level interaction; a character (your player avatar) activating a prop (the door).

Permissions define character-prop or character-character interactions.
Permissions define outcomes to said interactions.
Restrictions
A restriction can be an exception to a permission, such as being unable to open locked doors without unlocking them first, or it can be a more general restriction such as not being able to open doors that are locked at all or having to stay inside the boxing ring or you get disqualified.

This last part is important, because a restriction also needs consequences. The consequence can be that the game simply disallows the restricted thing, but it gets more interesting if the consequence has a playable effect. You can climb wet rock faces in BotW all you want, but it will be a frustrating and Stamina-draining experience compared to waiting until the rain passes.

Restrictions define exceptions to permissions.
Restrictions define consequences to attempts going against them.
Conditions
Lastly, conditions are the rules that frame everything else. Things like how a game starts or ends, or how you win or lose. This isn’t always tied into the permissions or restrictions of your game, but it can be. For example, it could be that after you’ve opened all the doors the game tells you its narrative secret and is then over. A condition can also be the rain in BotW, that modifies the state-space on a global level.

Conditions define framing for permissions and/or restrictions.
Conditions define high level rules for the game state.

It’s sometimes suggested that SPI’s Air War has the most complex rules ever written. (TSR reprint depicted.)
Designing Systems
“It’s not about how clever and creative you are as a designer—it’s about how clever and creative players can be in interacting with the game world, the problems, and the situations you create.”

Warren Spector
Game design risks becoming a kind of introspective navel-gazing at its worst. To prevent this, one way is to divide it into six separate stages with clear practical deliverables at each stage. You can meander a bit between stages, but you can never go back to the first three stages once you have passed the Commitment stage. Then you must stop entirely with the “fluffy” parts of design.

One reason is that you actually need all these stages. If a coworker asks you to deliver a finished design before you have been able to pass through Exploration properly, you are likely to commit to something half-baked that may have to change down the line. This costs time and money, and easily causes frustration.

Stage 1: Ideation
In ideation, we ideate. For a systemic game, this is about identifying the components and rules we think that our game needs. Contrary to most developers’ gut instinct, this isn’t the time to write code or build prototypes—it’s a time to figure out what systems you need. Writing the code is about turning a design into something concrete, but if you do this too early you will miss important pieces of the puzzle and you are likely to waste a lot of time on things you don’t actually need. This is where a heavy emphasis on technology often comes from.

Core Idea
Whatever concept you choose should be used to inform the rest of your game. Part of Thief: The Dark Project‘s genius is that you can adopt the game’s mental model straight from the title. You’re a thief—you will pick pockets, steal valuables, burglarise manors, etc. All of it makes sense.

The core idea can start from many different types of concepts but will be informing everything you do and therefore needs to answer the 5W+H questions around your concept. It needs to tell a story, not as a narrative but to provide a mental model for the player.

Some examples of what you can start from:

A conflict: winning the race, the tournament, championship, etc. Not always as clear-cut as this. Many survival games fall into this, since you’re competing against nature from the perspective of classical literary conflicts.
A role: the thief, the bodyguard, the soldier, the news reporter, the paladin, the cat lady; whichever role you set, it’s one of the most powerful core ideas you can have and will help you figure out all the other things much more easily. Think of what mindset you want the player to have; what role-play you want them to get into.
A goal: finding your missing parent, delivering your dead wife’s ashes, avenging your murdered family; you can let a strong goal define much of what your game is about. A game about vengeance is likely to be violent, for example.
A story: starting from a narrative core idea is actually quite dangerous for systemic games, because there’s a great risk that you start writing scripts and having assumptions about what the players will be doing, feeling, etc. But having a few central beats, factions, etc., that you start from can definitely help, and is also where you’re bound to begin if you are using an existing IP. Approach it how you can write an adventure for tabletop role-playing games: prepare the premise, but don’t prepare the plot.
Activities and Resources
Given the core idea, you need to figure out what the main activities are. The things you do all the time as the foundation for the game. Avoid making this a list of features, however. Write verbs at a fairly high level at first. “Fight,” for example; not “Quick Attack, Heavy Attack, Low Attack,” etc.

You’re working from a fiction to start with and should avoid contaminating your vision with game parlance for as long as you can. Most definitely avoid genre labels at this stage, because the conversation that follows convention will always be one about definitions, and this conversation won’t help your game design.

Connected to your activities, you want to figure out the key resources of your game and how they are handled. A resource can be health, time, stamina, gold, or something else. Every game has some kind of resource.

With activities and resources summed up, you move on to the rules. Permissions, restrictions, and conditions. What happens if you run out of the resource, or gain too much of it. How the resource is regained if it’s lost, if it can be regained at all. How the game ends, how it begins, how the resources designed progress through that flow. Once you know what can go wrong, you figure out what happens when things don’t go wrong and how that can be used to incentivise the player.

Systems
To be able to start exploring you need to sum up all the systems that must be tested. Keep this simple at first. If your game is a driving game, it’s likely to have a system for car customisation (a Car System), one for driving (a Driving System) and another for the track (a Track System). That can be good enough to start with, even if you know that there’ll have to be a Competition System to keep track of the score and lap count, as well as an Opponent System that drives AI cars on the track.

Also note that systems aren’t exclusively about gameplay. Depending on the size of your team, you will also want to explore technical art systems, animation systems, sound systems, and systems related to all other areas of your game

A list of high-level systems that you will be trying out in Exploration.
Stage 2: Exploration
Once we know what we want to be immersed in, we can move forward into exploration. The trickiest part of all comes up here: it’s impossible to test synergies without multiple systems to synergise. This means that exploration will take longer for a systemic design than for most other types of games. It also means that you can’t test things in isolation, because it won’t tell you anything about the validity of your design.

Many game projects plan the bulk of their time for production. Making levels, assets, content. For a systemic game, since exploration and preproduction are more time-intensive, you need to put a much bigger emphasis on exactly those areas.

My ideal is to put 50% of your time into prototyping/preproduction and wait until the second 50% to do any production. In reality, this is rarely feasible because of hard deadlines or stakeholder demands. (Incidentally, one of the many reasons I think gaming has been afraid of systemic development for a couple of decades.) But at the very least, make sure to put a lot of time into testing your assumptions. Because some of them will be wrong, and you don’t want to find this out after having already spent all your time and money.

Analogue Prototyping
Some of the fastest prototyping you can ever do is analogue prototyping. Using wooden cubes, dice, and perhaps some printed cards or tables to represent dynamics you want from your systemic game.

What’s great about analogue prototypes is that you can represent complex processes using very simple mechanics. If you want a few different outcomes from a fight, for example, or want guards or animals or something else to behave intelligently, you can simply use another player to represent the choices they make. Give that player a card or sheet of paper that lists their options, and you’ll be able to try things out within five minutes.

You can make role-playing games that rely more heavily on imagination, or you can make playable board game prototypes. For same games, such as digital card games, you can prototype the whole game in analogue form and get a fairly accurate representation of how it’ll work once finished.

Prototyping
You can put something together in exploration that demonstrates a very specific mechanic and nothing else, or explores just a couple of different systems. What’s important is that you do not keep this around after it has proven what it was made to prove.

A throwaway prototype should never take more than a day to build. Preferably even less. On one project, I had an idea to make a camera that would automatically make sure that all important points of interest remained on-screen. My idea for doing this was to have the camera automatically keep a bounding volume’s min and max corners on-screen and to adapt camera placement and zoom if the size of this bounding volume changed. When points of interest were added or removed, the bounds would be resized to encapsulate all relevant points of interest.

This took an hour to write and demonstrated the idea. Whether it was successful or not was a discussion with the team. It still clearly demonstrated what I had in mind.

One reason to do things this way is that it’s not speculative. Even something obviously broken or half-baked can sometimes prove an idea, whereas a long meeting can’t really prove anything and more easily boils down into a polarised argument.

Have an idea? Try it, evaluate it, make a decision on it, and move on. This is what exploration is really about.

Proofing
In printing, a proof shows you an accurate representation of how a design will look like when professionally printed. This is done to make sure that the material feels right, the colors look right, and so on.

The same line of thinking can be applied to systemic design, where a proof demonstrates the validity of a specific system. You shouldn’t delve into the synergies or other properties of the system at this stage. Only the system itself.

If a system proof takes more than a week to build (maybe up to a month for something that’s bigger or more complex) you’ve probably moved into tooling or even production without noticing and should move on to the next proof. But before you move on from a proof, you need to agree on how and where it fits and also list all of the improvements you will need to make during production. This is where technical literacy becomes a prerequisite, because many of the improvements that are needed will be immediately obvious to the disciplines involved but can be deeply esoteric for everyone else.

Let’s say you’ve built an animation system and it’s working mostly as intended, but it still looks glitchy, doesn’t always transition as intended, and feet are sliding across the ground. Most of the solutions to these problems are self-evident, even if they will need work. At this point, you shouldn’t fix them. Not yet. Start building your production backlog, so you don’t forget them. That foot sliding will be handled using root motion and inverse kinematics on the feet, maybe. Note that down. Just don’t get stuck. You want to prove all the systems you have intended for your game before you can fully grasp what you are making.

Build a proof to “good enough,” then move on to the next one.


Proofs are used extensively in printing, to make sure that things translate well from screen to print.
Merge Checkpoints
Because developers sometimes get tunnel vision and go on mental journeys both far and wide, it’s important to focus back on the product you’re making now and then. A merge checkpoint means a couple of weeks of putting everything done so far together into a cohesive whole. This exercise is always useful, and doing it semi-regularly is crucial to avoid project fragmentation during a long preproduction. It can also help avoid buildup of unnecessary technical debt, since unrelated proofs may start straying too much in different directions if they are left isolated.

The most important part of this, and why it needs to be part of exploration, is that it reminds you of the product you’re working on. It’s too easy in game development to get stuck watching nothing but what’s on your own screen.


Merge checkpoints are there to prevent this type of situation. (Illustration from Joel Burgess’ incredible level design article.)
Stage 3: Commitment
You will spend a lot of time bouncing back and forth between Ideation and Exploration, until you feel that you finally understand the game you’re building (or time runs out). Then it’s high time to commit to what you are making. To finalise your design.

When the commitment stage is done, you can never go back. What you’re committing to is the product that you will be building. There are many reasons to put a hard line between ideation/exploration and what comes next, not least of all that many game designers have a really hard time stopping.

Facts
With prototypes thrown away and systems proofed, it’s easier to reach conclusions. The smallest possible unit of agreement is the fact, where we can say something like, “the player kills enemies using guns” or “the player character is a llama whose name is Lola,” because those are things everyone on the team has agreed on. But it needs to be specific enough to be workable.

Once your list of facts gets longer and longer, you’ll realise that you’ve suddenly designed your game one tiny incremental decision at a time. There will also be synergies coming up just from the associations you can make from individual facts.


In game design, there’s no room for “alternative facts.”
Pillars
A pillar can be likened to an Internet meme. The idea is that you can have stated goals with your design that can be communicated across your team and used to validate every single decision that gets made. It can’t be too generic (“fast-paced”), but must be continuously reinforced and referred back to until everyone understands what it’s about.

Twenty (!) years ago, when we worked on a small school project, we used the term “high-tech low-tech” to talk about a science fiction setting where we’d mix Mayan influences with space ships. This meme stuck to the point that it almost became a joke, but that was good for the project since it meant everyone could align around it. So don’t feel bad if your cool grimdark design pillar gets laughed at. In fact, it can actually be even better than the opposite.


You don’t have to use actual memes, but it helps!
Object Map
These games are object-rich, as we know. A large part of systemic design is to be able to apply conceptual models to objects in a simulated world. To be able to do this, you need to map out all of the objects you will have in your game.

If you want, you can do a bit of object-oriented thinking here as well. Consider if something is-a or has-a. A goblin is an enemy, for example. The goblin also has a weapon, a helmet, and maybe a dream about retiring to live with their family on a remote farm some day.

You can also add some character and/or story context by adding what characters may want. This way, you will often be able to spot conflicts and the like completely naturally, or fill them in where they are missing. If only one character wants a thing, there’s no conflict there, so maybe you can just skip the thing or add conflict.

Just remember to keep things short and to the point.


Each game has different needs when it comes to object definitions.
State-Space
With all of the objects mapped out, you can also map out all the states that these objects can be in. I like doing this as part of the prototyping, because it means both that I can respect encapsulation in code and that I can build things fairly rapidly. It’s also a good way to enable layering, so I can turn things on and off and test other things in isolation.

When you map a systemic game’s state-space, you can’t be too specific however. Leave room for inputs and outputs; allow the state-space to be flexible. For example, even if the player is in the Vaulting state as illustrated below, it should probably still be possible to get shot, hit by a trap, decide to fire a gun yourself, or whatever else the game may have on offer. You will start seeing many of these cases when you map your states.


Parts of the state-space for characters in a personal project.
Rules
With all of the exploration you’ve done by now, you should be ready to write out all of those permissions, restrictions, and conditions that we talked about. At this point in your exploration you know what your game is about and you know how this can be communicated to players.

A rule can be, as was alluded to previously, “you can always fire your weapon.” Clever readers among you will of course understand that this is really close to a fact, so the first thing you should do when you try to finalise your game’s rules is to go through all of your facts and see which ones are also rules. Some of them often are.

The difference is that a fact is merely an agreed-upon thing in the game design, while a rule is something we need to teach the player. A player-facing fact, in a way.


Just a quick headsup: your rules are not supposed to take up hundreds of pages.
Possibility Space
With the object list, state-space and rules designed, you will see the full game emerge. What can be called the game’s possibility space is the combination of the rules interacting with all the objects and their states. Since we’re about to commit to this game and push it into production, it’s highly likely that you will want to control this process.

For example, “you can always fire your weapon” clashes with the two-handed carry heavy object state. Also, something needs to happen if you don’t have a weapon and try to fire it. In many of these cases, you will want to make exceptions. They can be for visual reasons, for example that it doesn’t look good to have someone fire their pistol while carrying a heavy object. It can also be for reasons of “nerfing,” and that you feel it will become too good or not good enough.

But here’s a crucial truth with systemic design: you need to let go of this authorship. Let go. Let the possibility space be an amorphous thing that you can’t quite control, because it’s the players who should be having the fun.

One-Page Designs
One of the best game design talks I’ve ever seen is Stone Librande’s talk on one-page designs. For systemic design, this pairs incredibly well with Aleissia Laidacker’s talk on systems if you want even more background for how this all comes together.

This is, finally, what your output should be at the commitment stage. You should write one one-pager for each system and for each component, rule, and so on, until you’ve covered all of the facts, resources, inputs, outputs, and feedback hooks in your game design.

While writing one-pagers, it helps to establish a standard. Maybe you’ll capitalise words to show that those words are the headlines of other one-pagers. The neat thing about this is that you can quickly iterate on your one-pagers down the line, by simply bumping up the version number and/or update date and replacing it with the new one. By keeping every responsible developer referenced on the one-pager, you will also facilitate information sharing and work process.

I personally swear by one-page designs, but it’s really important that you don’t rush into making them. Do the ideation and exploration properly, then you can sum it up as one-page designs.

One nice touch to make it more visible when something is changed is to add a colored line to the edge of a one-page design paper each time it’s upgraded. This way, people can quickly see that the previous one-line design suddenly has two lines and that they should take a new look.


Illustration of one-page design, from my book, The Game Design Toolbox.
The Design Board
A design board is a whole mosaic of one-page designs that describe all object interactions in your game. It can be added to, updated, and used as a live document more easily and much more visibly than most other methods of immortalising game designs.

In an ideal world, you can have all of the one-page designs printed out and placed on a wall somewhere, but something like a Miro board is often more practical.

How you place your designs on a board is a science in itself, since the relationship between one-page designs isn’t always clear-cut. If you have Prop as a design, and Weapon is a type of prop, how do you then place the Rocket Launcher that both is a weapon and spawns rockets that are potentially also pawns?

As with so many other things in game design, how you prefer to organise your design board will be up to preferences, space, and some experimentation. But once you have this board completed and you feel that everything is present that will be a part of your game design, you’re done committing, and it’s time to make and deliver this game of yours.


Lots of one-page designs together form a design board.
Next Steps
The savvy reader will notice that we’re only covering the first three of the six stages. We’ve talked about letting go and learning to love it, and we’ve gone through a whole slew of terminology that will aid you in designing systemic games.

Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts for the next step. To learn how to make systemic games, you must make systemic games. Designing, planning, and finishing systemic games. I will get into the delivery aspect of this process, and the three remaining design stages, in a future article. But for now, you need to get out there and make systemic games.

Unless you send me an e-mail at annander@gmail.com and ask to pay me to do it for you, of course. Or simply to tell me how wrong I am. But I want to play more systemic games, so hopefully you’re now running off to make them!

Great point about resisting the urge to restrain players from discovering and exploring fun.

It’s one of the big clashes: the one between authorship and emergence. The first assumes the author knows best, while the second wants the player to have their own experience.

Hey, thanks for your insight again! First: You’re awesome! I learn so much stuff and I’m glad to get some insight into your thought processes, thanks for blogging :)!

I’ve some questions. Do you have some “templates” for One-Pagers or other Game Design / “Systemic Programming” related things that you can share that are established in your thought process?

I’m currently working on a game that should (fingers crossed…) be really systemic and I keep thinking about “cogs” that influence each others basically. And since I did most of the coding so far in our team (we’re 5 people now), I jumped from “cog” to “cog” over time and I’ve made the experience that if I move on to another “cog”, it will improve the previous one more often than not, because the system gets “tested” if it’s interacting with another system.

For example: I have a weapon, I can shoot, it explodes if I shoot against a wall, I added a crate, it’s destructible, if I shoot the crate, it gets destroyed and drops its contents (3 breads lol). After that I added a basic enemy (that is also an Actor entity, as the player), I added a second one, they killed each other, so I added a target system. Now the enemies don’t only attack me, but also the crate if I lure them over there 😀 everything works as intended.

It was my first small “magic moment”, because now I just define “attack this and that, ignore these, interact with this, but don’t interact with that” basically.

Now I asked myself if I should maybe define “cogs” inside my game design document that describes a somewhat “self contained” system? I like to look at each system in isolation and think about how it can be interacted with and what possible synergies could emerge then.

Another question I have is: You’ve talked a lot about play-state and states in general in this article. Do you think that statemachines are useful for a systemic-approach or do you think it’s mostly useful for game design documents etc.? I’m asking, because I perceive state machines as quite “static”, you’ve to clearly define what interacts with what and generally you make sure that an entity “is” in just one state and not in multiple simultaneously (except for compound states or something like that) and you make sure that it’s “not” in other states. For me it’s part of the “emergence” that I can’t “control” in what state the relevant entity is.

So is it only “for documentation” to get a common understanding of the possibilities etc. or would you also define those states somewhere in code?

I will be sharing some one-pagers from personal projects in future posts, but you should also take the time to watch my inspiration, Stone Librande: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXmsxYm0Mk0

Love hearing about your magic moment. I had some of those in the past few years that really cemented my ideals around systemic design. When you see things clicking in interesting ways.

With states, I use statemachines extensively. Go into it in detail here: https://playtank.io/2023/11/12/state-space-prototyping/

The reason for this is that you’re designing the different states and properties different entities/objects can have. It’s not so much about enforcing states but simply a handy way to parcel out content and logic in a more modular fashion.

Great I found the transcript! 


all right I'll go ahead and begin my name is Stone Le Brandy I'm the creative director at EA Maxis and I've been
0:10
working in the game industry for over 10 years now and during that time I've written literally hundreds of design
0:16
documents of all sorts of different types all the way from small like small scale web applications all the way up to
0:23
huge like multi-million dollar PC and console titles so I've covered a pretty wide spectrum of design during that time
0:30
and a lot of the designs that I've written um some are to be read by Executives or programmers or artists of
0:36
the marketing department um and no matter what I found that there's one type of design document that clearly um
0:42
does a better job than any other type and that's the one-page design document so I'm going to go over talk about some
0:47
of those and show you some examples um first I wanted to start out and talk a little bit about standard design
0:53
documentation and uh this is the stuff that you might see in your office already um just wanted to talk about the
0:59
pros and cons of those and um give you some context about the onepage designs
1:04
then we'll talk more about the onepage design documents that's majority of the talk and that's mostly just me showing some examples of designs that I've
1:10
worked on over time I kind of want you to leave this session with the encouragement or the enthusiasm to
1:17
create your own design documents one page designs when you get back to your own shops uh raise your hands if you're
1:22
designers and you actually write design documents good perfect audience for this
1:28
talk um so hopefully you'll learn a few tips and tricks along the way and things that you can try out and then uh just
1:34
kind of summarize at the end talking about some of the benefits and uh ended up there so I wanted to start out
1:40
talking about design Bibles and who's ever read a design Bible cover to cover
1:46
okay so and most of you have probably been in the industry for a while because those are kind of the dinosaurs now so a
1:51
design Bible is usually printed it's could be easily 100 or more pages and uh
1:58
heavy mostly heavy text based type of document you print it out you bind it up and then you hand it out to the team and
2:05
that's kind of the Bible it's a very authoritative source of all the information in the game um usually if
2:11
you're going to write one of these things you would start out with a template or an outline in word and uh
2:17
back in the 90s when I first started coming to GDC there was actually talks about here here's my my template that I
2:23
use and Chris Taylor actually still have his outline that he had um that he presented one year and so these like
2:30
basically a checklist if I get this document I go into word and I fill out every single thing on this chart then
2:37
I'm done with the design like what else is there to do this is every possible thing that could happen in a video game and so therefore if I completely filled
2:43
in the whole thing I can just hand off print it out hand it out and then just go home because uh now I just have to
2:49
wait for those people to build the thing that I wrote up um and there actually it seems you know I'm being slightly um
2:56
sarcastic there but there's actually some companies people I've talked to that said programmers like I've never even saw our designers they sit on
3:01
another floor I see their design documents but I never see them I never get to talk to them it's a very one-way flow that's back in the uh '90s and that
3:09
company is no longer a business um but I'm sure there's still companies who use this approach to creating design
3:15
documentation uh here's one of the very first ones I wrote this is like in 1997 a game called creature ball at a St a
3:21
small startup company I was at and this is a little web based game and here's the first page and as you can see uh
3:28
this is pretty much what most pages of design Bibles look like um just big masses of text Page after page after
3:35
page and they're really thorough if you actually bother to read it just huge amounts of information are contained in
3:41
this um but really daunting so you know you throw in a few illustrations you try to make it compelling but if you kind of
3:47
look at up what's going on up here there's like every icon every sound effect um all the different UI options
3:53
what a rightclick menu does uh have the game design part um and so on you just
3:58
breaks it all down the physics sound effects artwork requirements time estimates and so on and this was a pretty small proposal too um so you can
4:06
kind of like see where this can go now you if you start making bigger ones I started searching around and I found
4:12
leisure suit Larry's Casino online so I downloaded this from 1997 also this is
4:17
again the kind of standard back in the 90s of how to do design documents um same thing big table of contents this
4:23
one's about 30 pages long um first page huge massive text again uh this one the
4:29
women in that you're going to meet along the way and you know some interface stuff I like this this little stuff
4:35
chart up here I don't know if you can read it but it says different things you can buy like roses condoms and disinfectant which are like the three
4:41
things you need for a perfect date in Leisure suer um the Grim Fandango document
4:48
double fine uh Tim Schaefer released this up on their website a while back and since it's been taken down but like
4:54
anything on the internet once it goes up it never comes back down really um this one was really cool cuz it wasn't a word
4:59
document it was a PDF it was scanned all the pages so you actually see like notes and stuff scribbled on the document
5:05
which makes it gives it this really like authentic like this Dusty Tome you know this Bible of information and this one's
5:11
about 70 pages long and it's a really great read if you can find it I I recommend like trying to track it down
5:17
and and read through it um the last page here the cut scene the final farewell and um has this little probably Tim
5:25
Schaefer I'm sure did something like this U but there's this kind of feeling like when you finally get through one of
5:31
these as the author like you do just want to cry like this is it I've done it you know I finally finished this thing
5:37
now I can just go home and please execute it like this and everybody's going to be happy so the pros like I've
5:44
been saying it's the definitive source of all the information about the game it's incredibly thorough um everything's
5:49
in one place it's in this book you can actually hand it to somebody they can take it home with them um they don't need to be plugged into a computer to
5:55
read it and the most important thing for me as a designer I still use this approach actually I just don't don't show anybody my documents anymore I just
6:01
keep them to myself because this is as a design process it's the most the best
6:07
process you can possibly use because the act of writing that document is the act of Designing um you know a lot of people
6:13
I'm a designer have these ideas in my head but as soon as you sit down and have to write that sentence out that describes that you realize it's like oh
6:19
wait should I write this or that and that moment that that little flash of insight where you're like man I have to
6:24
commit right now and sometimes like I'm just sitting there for like 15 minutes just thinking in my head that sentence
6:30
should be you know it's a very slow it can be very painful writing style but you're guaranteed to know the stuff
6:35
inside and out when you're done um cons of course it just doesn't scale up most of these documents were in the 90s well
6:41
we were still shipping games on floppy discs you know back then um teams were much smaller as teams get bigger and
6:46
bigger and projects get bigger you just can't you know do this anymore if you had to update the document let's I want
6:51
to change one sentence like how am I going to do that I've already printed 20 copies I've handed it out I'm going to go through and unbind them all and
6:57
change this paper and just put in this one sentence and how is everybody going to know I did that um and it's printed
7:03
you know so it's difficult to search and even if you have the word document of it then it's still kind of a pain to search
7:08
through so of course uh we've moved on from those and now we're in the the era of the design Wiki and raise your hand
7:15
if as a designer you work on a design Wiki okay so most of you do these days um you know when I went over uh when I
7:21
left blizzard and I went over to EA it's was like this huge difference cuz when I was at Blizzard at the time uh we were actually trying to get a Wiki I see
7:27
Wyatt here uh uh we were were like trying we want a Wiki and it was like a little pressure against that um but over
7:33
at EA it was just you don't see any printed stuff everything's on the wiki um so in as simple as form a design Wiki
7:40
is really just the same thing like you have this big template and you fill it out it's just the process is a little
7:46
different you double click and then you type in your stuff and then you hit enter and then that section is filled out so this is from the Spore Hero Arena
7:52
and it's just as very basically just as dry as anything else but it follows a very similar format um this is from the
8:00
Spore front page and it's kind of nice and attractive but it's just was a no man's land underneath each of those
8:05
links you know so any any team who each had their own links there for the different games in Spore could really
8:10
just do anything they wanted uh there wasn't a lot of control over the process and therefore um it just kind of gets to
8:17
be a little Tangled mess of spaghetti after a while you can't find stuff and it's like I know I put that up there but I can't remember did I ever link to it
8:22
you know where is it um this one when I worked on The Simpsons project at EA this was like undoubtedly the best uh
8:30
Wiki that I've ever worked on and the reason why is we had a producer Hans ten Kate and um his job was to manage the
8:37
wiki his full-time like you're the producer you're in charge of the wiki and he took it very seriously uh he made
8:43
sure everybody followed the rules and did what they were supposed to do and things went in their right place and it got updated he made this cool mind map
8:48
so you could see the whole like this is the game design document you know this was our Bible um just all online it
8:54
makes it really easy so you know I would have a link and I would click on it and you know I'm working on marges mini games or whatever and I could put in
9:00
illustrations I could do all this stuff um Pros easy access easy to update just
9:06
double click type away everything's kind of in its own little compartments you get the whole team can work on it it's not just one person doing it anybody can
9:12
click on it um and because of that it's great to have history and tracking so that you know who made those changes and
9:18
when they made them uh problem like I said it requires constant maintenance and a more subtle problem is it starts
9:25
to hide design relationships um and I'll talk more about this as you'll see in some of the one page designs but because
9:30
everything is chunked up it's hard to get a sense of how it all fits together into one hole um you can look at say
9:37
that front page and get a sense of oh here's the index but it doesn't really show you the relationships between all those parts um and this is low
9:45
resolution you're going to see this over and over again as I give this talk I'm trying to take 300 600 dot per inch images that I print out and put them up
9:52
on this screen yeah it's a huge screen but the DPI is just terrible 72 DPI here
9:57
and up here so you you just lose a lot um that you a printer is just much better at and the other thing is uh the
10:04
viewport limitation which is you're constantly design as a designer I'm forced to like fit everything into this
10:09
arbitrarily small rectangle like what if my design is long and wide like no one
10:14
wants to scroll across to see it what if it happens to be this way I got to scroll what if it's both ways and you know got to zoom in and out it's just
10:20
really a pain um to get the information up there I think it's really constraining uh two designs to force
10:25
yourself to like everything has to be viewed through this glass window in front front of your audience all right so a bigger problem
10:32
of both of those is that as a designer you hear this all the time well I write all this documentation but nobody ever
10:38
reads it and it's true no one ever really reads much of anything anymore um you can whether it's printed whether
10:45
it's on a um computer screen on a Wiki you're emailing it to somebody oh I'll I'll read that later it's they look at
10:51
the scroll bar there's actually been some eye tracking studies recently where they say people look at the headlines and the pictures and then they look at
10:56
the scroll bar bar and if it's too big then they exit the web page you it's oh I don't want to scroll man like but if
11:02
it's short then they'll stick around uh same thing with when you send people email and they look at wikis and stuff like that the exact same thing happens
11:08
and they I'll get to it later but then it Scrolls off the email list and then it's gone um so of course the solution
11:14
and what this talk is about is only use one page um and that's what we'll talk about so some Inspirations first before
11:21
I show the actual documentation uh when I was younger I wanted to be an architect and so I took a lot of
11:26
drafting classes um architectural classes and I really love this style um
11:31
here we have like an architect architectural view if I'm the client if I'm going to live in the building I want
11:36
to see the elevation that plan there isn't that's kind of mysterious to me I kind of understand what it is but
11:42
there's a lot of information that I don't need if I'm a contractor I don't even want to see the elevation view it's kind of meaningless to me I don't care
11:48
where the trees are going to be planted but I need to know the spacing between the 2x4s and the walls and things like
11:53
that so you can get a lot of information on one page and you can focus it towards different audiences really easily um of
11:59
course we've all played with Legos and you've got to really appreciate their design documentation um no words you
12:06
know five years old uh kids can follow this stuff easily even younger um this kind of stuff for me
12:12
this is like I it's kind of sad it tells a lot about me but I get emotional looking at drawings like this like it's
12:17
it's so beautiful like look at that um you know imagine if I had to say like I'm going to make the Wiki page of the
12:22
wiki design document of this it'd be a whole bunch of chunks the intercooler the vertical cooling fins and you wouldn't really see that relationship
12:28
between all those things um but these kind of uh the craftsmanship and um the information that's contained in just
12:35
this one page is just incredible um kids placemats another great inspiration for those of you have kids you go to the
12:41
store and you buy these plastic placemats or maybe remember them when you were a kid filled with information
12:46
they're colorful they're fun like you just you want to look at them while you're eating you move your food aside so you can look at what's going on and
12:52
then you spill it all on the table which is the whole you know the opposite point of having a place mat in the first place um but if the the job is done right it's
12:59
like place mats are always onepage design documents and I've seen a bunch of them um you know dinosaurs and then
13:04
they have like you know the States United States of America with funny little icons and bears in yose and things like
13:10
that um this one raise your hand if you've seen this chart this a very famous chart okay so uh few of you have
13:16
this is um a graph that shows Napoleon's March into Moscow and the width of the
13:22
line is the size of his army uh the tan line is him going out and the black line
13:27
is him coming back uh so you know very powerful lots of information the temperatures down there on the bottom
13:33
the dates where they cross rivers so the information contained in this diagram is just uh really incredible um and it's
13:40
also making a very powerful statement like if I were to tell you what I just told you any other way like you might not have the impact about what really
13:46
went on when he sent out his troops and how they came back again so those are all like examples that have inspired me
13:52
to start working on my own onepage designs it's like hey here's you know it could be done it's clearly can be done so let's try to do this in our uh game
13:59
design too um so I started out when I was working at blizzard I was working at blizzard North on uh the Diablo I
14:05
project and I was doing some UI design as well and a lot of UI design if you've done that it's flowcharts and so this is
14:11
an example of a flowchart that I made and kind of all fits on one page I had to use a legal siiz paper to get it all
14:17
to fit um again you're kind of seeing the limitations of uh what I can do on the screen here um but what I noticed
14:24
was is that one of the programmers had this hanging up in his office and on the wall and wasn't even working on that
14:30
particular part I'm like why do you have that up on their wall he's like Oh I thought it looked cool and I'm like wait
14:35
I write all these other documents these big you know fat documents that have information that you really need to read
14:41
and it's just sitting on your desk in a pile why don't you hang that up on the wall well you can't hang a book up on
14:46
the wall but it inspired me it's like hm could I start making my design documents so that people would want to hang them
14:52
on their wall because as a designer your goal is to communicate information to your audience and if they're hanging it
14:58
up on the wall like gee you're getting through to them they're actually paying attention to what you have to say and other people who come in their office
15:03
are seeing it too and asking for copies well that's a huge win so we started working on a game we called dhack and um
15:09
it's was basically Diablo combined with the Rogue hack Style game just to test our 3D engine it was early prototype so
15:16
like instead of documenting and writing all this text I'm just going to draw a picture of what it should look like there's a little town a little cave you
15:21
go in the cave and it just goes down like 100 levels and uh that's basically it and it's more of a prototype test of
15:28
of our tools and stuff than an actual game although it was kind of a fun game too um so I made this little document
15:33
and then we'd go into meetings we talk about it's like let's add this let's add that and so over time I started to like expand out and I would add these little
15:39
modules and just increase it um and you'll notice there's like a lot of notes and stuff written scribbled on this because I would take these into
15:45
meetings and actually like write on them and get information take them back and make the changes and print out a new one and um and so on now um so don't blink
15:53
I'm going to go ahead two years in the future so instead of going through step by step there you go so that's how it
15:58
ended up when I left like two years later this is the entirety of act one and I know you can't really see it and
16:04
I'm going to blame uh monitors again and loow uh DPI but when this is printed out
16:09
this is printed out on um on tabloid siiz paper so I started learning a trick
16:14
it's like hey paper comes in all sorts of sizes I can make onepage design documents I just got to keep using
16:20
bigger and bigger paper um you know and and it is kind of a trick but it's also
16:25
like why not like you know if you got the printer you got the paper like use this stuff um so if I zoom in a little
16:31
bit on this you can see it's not just it's not a level design document in the sense that I'm going to give it to a level designer to implement this it's a
16:37
highle view of the entire game in a way that you can't really see in any other way while you're playing the game you
16:43
never experience this way um but it has like every Waypoint every monster its model name its AI whether it's melee
16:50
whether it's like poison or electricity um what level we expect the player to be how far into the game they should be at
16:57
this time so it's almost like I like to think of it as like almost like a musical score like it shows me the whole
17:02
flow of the entire game and then we can just uh test you know when people play the game it's like oh you should be
17:07
level 13 when you get to Winterstone are you yes no okay we're doing good um actually speaking of the
17:14
Winterstone there that little town um you know So eventually it's like it becomes its own document and um still
17:21
pushing the limits of this like what can I do on one page how much information can I cram in when will it just like
17:26
explode when will people's head explode you know when will I break Adobe Illustrator once and for all and so I've
17:31
just started cramming all this stuff in there um but still trying to make it like hey I I want to read this I wish
17:37
this was a place mat that I could put my food on every day you know like um so
17:42
those were all they're kind of based on physical things you like the levels movement around in in Diablo so I started wondering it's like well what
17:48
about combat could you do an abstract system uh using these onepage design documents and this one here this is
17:54
concept art this isn't a one-page document because it doesn't really speak to the design of the game but it def definitely speaks to the feeling of the
18:00
game even though this never actually would ever happen um but I bring it up because this is what when you say combat
18:05
in Diablo it's like yeah look at that this is combat and Diablo but in my mind combat and Diablo sadly looks like this
18:13
um so this is what I sometimes call the football documents and they're like X's and O's and the players and O and the
18:19
monsters are x's and when you really look at Diablo and you break it down into a purely 2D Mouse clicking uh
18:25
exercise which arguably you know that's what it is you have to try to say like how many different ways can we get the player to click their Mouse on a 2d
18:32
plane and still keep their interest and so what variables can I play with how fast they click how long they hold down
18:38
how fast they're moving their mouse back and forth and so on and so this little chart was like well this is pretty much everything you can do in Diablo um at
18:45
the very like Atomic level and it kind of shows all these relationships now the fun part is you take all these atoms of
18:51
combat and then you start combining them up into higher and higher level spells and abilities where they all start to
18:56
hook together and you get all these like uh combin between the two and so we would make a a single page for each one
19:02
of the skills that we were working on um and also just a quick disclaimer I don't work at blizzard anymore and I'm
19:08
not working on Diablo I so hopefully um you know don't there's nothing that I'm hopefully giving away why it's Smiley at
19:15
me all right because he still works there um so a little quick switch over
19:20
from the blood and violence and demons over to the happy colorful land of Springfield uh when I left um blizzard
19:26
North and went over to EA my first project was working on Springfield and oh can you you know you'll be the lead
19:32
level designer on the Springfield like this is so easy all I have to do is watch Simpsons episodes all day and just
19:38
copy what they did in the show well unfortunately this was the best drawing that I could find um of what Springfield
19:45
looks like according to the show which is not too helpful for a level designer um but you know we run with it so I
19:51
grabbed a bunch of cardboard boxes and we took over the table in the middle of the design pit and little sticky notes
19:57
and we're just like okay let's let's figure out let's play with some things and in my mind this is a one-page design
20:03
document yeah I'm not printing it out but it's like it's still like one page everything is there in front of people
20:08
and plus it's in a very prominent spot at the office you couldn't get in or out of your cube without walking around this
20:13
table and so it became this very Central kind of like War Room approach almost of like okay let's gather around the
20:18
Springfield and and let's like try to assemble this beast and figure out where everything's going to be and over time we started decorating it and you know
20:25
like kind of making it a little nicer and better and figuring out where all the little stickies need to go um and we eventually kind of came up
20:30
with this diagram this is a very highlevel uh chart of how the different elements hooked together and I kind of
20:36
could have ended it like right there because we had done some of the work but I we started after we took the cardboard
20:41
off the table I'm like you know I'm kind of missing that and plus EA has these awesome plotters um you know very big
20:48
wide plotters so you can just print these huge posters and like I said well hey I'm going to like use as much paper
20:54
as I can and see how I how far I can press uh push on this one page designed document idea so you know I started
21:00
printing out these big maps and then eventually started cutting out little uh 2D um little build art you know 2D
21:06
standup so that we can make it a little more 3D and eventually we came up this was when I left the project this was the
21:12
uh the final version of Springfield um I it's really hard to like show you again because of the resolution so um I'll see
21:20
if I can switch into illustrator here and show you in just a second but I was also again I could have just stopped right here on this thing but I had also
21:27
done about 25 interior years and each of these was its own one-page design document that I would give to a level
21:32
designer where they would go through and they say like oh we need fries and a burger shelf and Buzz Cola for crusty
21:38
burger so we need to contact our Outsourcing company and make sure those are all on the list and you know whether
21:44
this thing is like has physics and whether it's edible and so on so um did
21:49
tons of these so I had them all there and I'm like you know this I'm not filling up the paper enough I have more
21:55
table space so I try to stick every single one of those buildings onto um that main drawing just had this huge
22:02
poster I wanted to bring it in it's just like too unwieldy to carry around with me um so let's see if I can do the the
22:08
next best thing this is kind of a bit of an experiment here so this is the actual illustrator document that we're looking
22:13
at right now and um you know so if I zoom down in here
22:18
like you can actually see the the Quicky Mart is over there and and little police cars and the police station and stuff
22:24
like that and I try not to when I'm working on these things I try really not to do a lot of extraneous just goofy um
22:31
stuff I try to make everything actually have a reason for being there like I really wanted police cars in the game so
22:36
like let's make a note of that kind of shows where every character is and then these call outs over here uh where we
22:41
can go and we can look at um each of these things and because we're working with a vectorbase program you know I can
22:47
really like have tons of information you can kind of Zoom all the way down into the scratch off ticket and learn about
22:54
the scratch off miname that's in there and this is all on one piece of paper and when you actually look at it on the
22:59
table you can this stuff is all very legible um I know on the screen it's making it look like well who would want
23:04
to squint and look at that it's actually pretty big and pretty easy to see um again you know printing on paper
23:11
makes a big difference okay so some examples of things I've worked on um say you want to
23:17
make one of these on your own so here's the template that I would
23:23
recommend you start with um go through all these things because they're all important so you want a title why are
23:28
you even making this thing and that's your title and if you can't even fill in the title then you probably should stop
23:34
right there um so make sure that you really know what you're trying to accomplish by making this design document in the first place otherwise
23:40
the battle's already lost and then date it this is another thing you're going to be printing these things out and so your
23:45
only type of way of knowing whether or not something's up to date is to look at that date and you just have to be very
23:51
disciplined about like every time you print that out make sure the date's up to date or I've discovered and this I'm
23:56
warning you about it is that it'll come back later and you're like which which one's the most recent I can't remember um lots of white space um you know when
24:04
you make a one-page design document what you don't want to do is take that design Bible that first intro page and just blow it up on a poster and hang it up on
24:11
the wall it's like there you go there's my onepage design document you know I I printed out tons of text on the wall
24:17
it's not going to help anybody so um you know use lots of white space um a main
24:22
illustration in the middle is always a good kind of graphic technique to draw people into it and then do call outs all
24:27
around it and notes and bullet points and things like that so again I've been mentioning Adobe Illustrator people you
24:33
know say how do you do all this stuff almost everything you see in this presentation was done in Adobe Illustrator and um I can't say enough
24:41
about like using Adobe Illustrator if you're trying to do this in Photoshop then just go home right now because um
24:47
Photoshop is just this nasty thing um for trying to do documents like this you
24:52
have to be very agile you have to be able to like um rotate and scale and move elements around and photo is just
24:58
terrible at doing that plus when you go print it on the giant plotter you still have your like terrible DPI or you've
25:05
done the whole document in high resolution and then it takes forever to load and you're using up like 80 megabytes to do this that whole
25:11
Springfield document I think was like 2 megabytes um because of the vector compression and it just prints
25:18
beautifully when you finally get around to printing these because uh it's a printer resolution not illustrator
25:24
resolution um so here's an example of kind of using that ideas there's a big drawing in the middle you know creature
25:30
traits is the title this was from a um kind of a pet training game that I worked on and I won't go through the you
25:36
know what the design really means here but the idea was that you start as a child and then they could depending on how whether you hit them a lot when they
25:42
were a kid or whether you nurtured them uh they would have different um different personalities so if you kind
25:49
of throw them around and you wrestle with them they'll become very physical and so the main three things were physical playful and creative and then
25:56
there was kind of Blends that you could mix so this kind of shows a lot of information it's in a very you know one page easy to kind of digest and then you
26:02
can kind of just explore it um you know if you're really compelled by it as you walk past it you see it on a wall you
26:08
can stop and you can look at the high Lev stuff which is the most important or you can start digging down into the the little tiny uh
26:14
details uh this is another one from the same game and a flowchart this is another thing to do if you're uh working
26:20
on a one-page design document I recommend trying to do a flowchart first if you haven't done many of these all
26:26
games have some kind of engine in them that loops around forever until uh the you know you die or you quit and this
26:33
game had a very simple flow to it that the um you know the player chooses an
26:38
action they're either like shaking the guy or treating the guy that gets fed back in and then the creature decides to
26:44
do things based on its needs and moods and its training and it just makes a simple Loop this this is a very simple document and just describes the main
26:50
flow of the game but it's pretty important because it's like the key element of like what can the player really do in this game and what's the
26:57
feedback coming back from the system so that the player knows what to do next and that's really Central to this
27:02
project so it was deserving of its own little document um here's what not to do
27:08
um I I just typed in bad flowchart into Google Images just to see what would come up uh to show you what not to do
27:14
and this one came up and it's actually something about the health bill so I was like first looking at it I'm like man
27:20
whoever did this was like the worst graphic artist ever it has so many obvious mistakes that this guy's a
27:27
complete idiot and should be fired and then I'm like looking at it's like it's so bad that it's purposely bad it was
27:32
done by Republicans to like obscure the issue I think um so now I think the guy's a genius for like actually like
27:38
setting that up um and you can use this own technique in your work I think if some other rival designer has a design
27:44
that you disagree with uh portray it this way and um obviously mine's better mine's clean
27:52
look at his um another thing that you can do is to um use
27:59
storyboards this isn't the story board in the the typical what you might think of as you know like you're going to do
28:04
your 30second video in between levels or whatever um this one is really showing
28:10
the entire game as a storyboard I don't know if you can see the text there but there's uh little timing marks just like
28:16
in the Diablo illustration that's showing where we expect the player to be at certain times in the experience and it goes all the way up through the whole
28:21
game cycle um as you move through the different phases of the the creatures life cycle um and this was is pretty
28:28
good like it shows you all the different key moments that the player is going to experience it doesn't go into a lot of detail but this is a great thing to give
28:35
to marketing or to an executive where you just like okay here's what we're building here's these moments and then you can flesh out any one of these
28:41
moments um as needed this one is from Spore and this
28:46
kind of shows this was inspired by that Napoleon uh diagram that I showed you earlier it's like oh in Spore we have
28:52
these creatures and they march across these islands so I'm going to use that same technique of showing space and time
28:59
and along the bottom there um is the the brain level it shows you how um powerful
29:04
your creature should be and that estimated time and how the game flows across the continent as you play it and
29:11
as you move through as you move across the continent the challenge starts to escalate up because we didn't want the player to sit on the beach when they
29:17
come up out of the water and Spore and just sit there the entire time and become this like huge Tyrannosaurus recks stomping on little jellyfish and
29:24
stuff at the the beginning we wanted to like incentivize you to move across but we also wanted to know like how long
29:29
should that take um and so I think it's really important when you're um working on a lot of these diagrams is like
29:34
really think about that time element and and get that in there somehow like because it's a really common question
29:39
you don't want to wait till after development is all done and say like let's find out hey can you play our game and see how long it takes to get through
29:45
like you would rather as a designer say we want our game to take one hour and now we can make our content and
29:50
everything match our uh intended design goals instead of finding out after the fact um this is another one this from a
29:57
Rob game that I was working on and the same kind of idea where it's got this like Central illustration in the middle
30:04
uh to kind of you know Focus the um attention so when you walk by it's like what what's that I'm going to stop and
30:10
and see what that thing is and little like the Hypno wheel the hypno toad or something in the middle to try to get
30:15
people to walk over to your drawing and then once they're there okay now no you can't leave now start reading because
30:21
I'm I want you to understand the game that you're working on um and then you can just start digging in and there's just like these layers of information
30:28
start to reveal themselves so you know on the one hand it could be like oh it might take you a week of walking back and forth across this hallway before
30:35
you've read this whole thing um but I can also you know but that's better than not reading at all and a lot of design
30:40
documentation is really Geared for a certain audience like oh this is just for a program or this is just for marketing so it's kind of nice to be
30:46
able to um you know have the whole team know what's going on across all the different departments and this is a good
30:52
way to U kind of get everybody involved in the process without calling a meeting and having to sit down and talk to them
30:58
but if you do call a meeting and you bring this in it's even better because now everybody has a common focus when I
31:03
start talking about some idea it's not just it's abstract and everybody's imagining something different I
31:08
guaranteed that everybody's Imagining the same thing that's in front of them because that's what I put on the paper for them to put into their brains uh so
31:15
a lot of different information in these diagrams um you know covers the whole flow of the game now what I'm trying to do in just kind of personal development
31:24
I guess is like find the Holy Grail of onepage design documents was can I fit an entire game design for the entire
31:30
game in one page um you know it's kind of well it's probably really hard to do but doesn't stop me from trying so I
31:37
just keep like pushing on the edges until like I said Till I make these things explode um you can also use it to talk
31:44
about like relationships between units and um actually real quick on this one um relationships between the modules
31:51
because this is such a high level thing it shows you how all the different areas interact with each other and how I can
31:56
get from one module to the next this one here is like now within that game let's talk about relationship
32:01
between units how do they all relate to each other and because they're in instead of a Wiki page just for the brutes and a Wiki page just for the
32:08
futurians and you know I can actually kind of start to see their relationships between each other in this one document
32:13
so we started out when I was working on this one this was the uh classic rock paper scissors um kind of design um
32:19
technique if you were at my talk last year I kind of railed about that a little bit but I use it all the time anyway um because it's so easy and so
32:26
it's like okay we'll have three robot ction and they'll just be like rock paper scissors and brutes beat aliens and Aliens beat futurians and futurians
32:32
beat brutes and we have kind of the archetype of each robot from movies and comic books and stuff you know the uh uh
32:39
the uh steampunk and little insect Bots and stuff and then people are like well what about Mech Warrior where does that
32:45
fit or what about those ones from um you know the Matrix movies where do they fit
32:51
in and I realized it's like this is a really constraining design space it really only gives the player one of
32:56
three choices when they decide to pick what faction they want to be there's very little room to maneuver um so just
33:03
looking at the diagram it occurred to me it's like oh the diagrams drawn wrong it would be much more powerful and much more uh design flexibility for the
33:11
player is if it was shaped like this instead so just a quick comparison this is where everything's in the corner in rock paper scissors and this I set them
33:17
up along the sides so now each race the futurians are actually a slider and the player can control that slider by what
33:23
parts they want to put on the robot so you can slide it all the way over to high damage or or you can slide it all the way over to fast and then you get
33:30
Eve from W um and so that gives the player like these whole tunable ranges
33:35
instead of me as a designer saying you have to be Rock papers or scissors you're like I'm going to be mostly scissors with just a little bit of rock
33:41
um and that's going to beat this other guy who's doing some other strategy and so we were able to get more robots put into it but also just make a much better
33:50
design um another common thing that you can do is make a matrix design and I love doing these I do them all the time
33:56
because it's such a great way to sort out design information so what you do instead of solving the problem from the
34:01
bottom up you just make your Matrix and you solve it from the top down so first of all you know make your Matrix you can
34:07
use Excel for this you don't need illustrator um you you know pick your attributes first and here's just the
34:12
Classic example of water Nature metal fire and some common character classes
34:17
and now that I have that done 90% of the design is like i' I've organized what
34:23
I'm going to be talking about the rest is just kind of the detail work but if you start from the bottom up then you
34:28
kind of get lost like where am I where does this go you know what's going on so if I fill this whole chart out and you know I just did this really quick just
34:34
um before the talk just to give this example but it was kind of like as I started putting it together it was kind of fun filling this Grid in um I wanted
34:41
two things per each class and three things for each faction and when I
34:46
started filling it in I knew which squares I needed to fill in and it just kind of started building itself and it was kind of like a a crossword puzzle
34:53
for game designers maybe you know you can take this challenge if you want just make these grids and try to fill them in see what you can come up with so you
34:59
know this kind of a madeup um example but here's a real world example this is from the cell game that's a lead
35:05
designer the cell game on Spore and here this is just really a matrix you know you look at it you're like oh awesome
35:12
placemat but at least I look at it and say that um but um it's really just this matrix it's got um the different levels
35:19
the five levels that you can go through and cell game and then the cells are sorted from the weakest the things that you're going to eat up to the most
35:25
powerful like the epics that will just stomp you in one bite and there's also other like
35:31
information in there about like what parts they drop and other little details like that but I started out with the
35:36
whole grid and just filled it in really easy to set that up once you have that going for you um taking it kind of a
35:42
step further it's like one of the programmers who was working on at Jeff Gates um he was kind of doing a bottomup
35:48
programming of the interactions between the different cells so when a cell with a spike hits a cell with poison who wins
35:54
and he would just like oh I need to answer that question so I'll just write a little bit in in there um but it was causing problems cuz it wasn't really
36:00
hard it was hard to know what had been um designed in all these cases so I went back and I did a top down design where I
36:07
said here's every possibility and then I went through filled on all the stuff then you know that you're really thorough you know you know that you've
36:13
covered all the bases and then you hand this off to the programmer and he can go through into a checklist and make sure
36:18
that everything's covered um it starts to break down though unfortunately if you get these
36:24
really like terrible Excel sheets with more than two Dimensions uh this one here had four dimensions and um what
36:31
it's talking about is there's a consequent system in Spore which is as you play through the game things that
36:36
you do as a cell and as a creature and in Civ and um um our tribe and Civ
36:42
affect what you're going to be like when you get into space and a lot of players don't realize this because a lot of players I talk to never get to space but
36:48
a lot of players um they only do it once and so they're just like oh I got to space and this is what happens but
36:53
really if you play it a couple times you realize when you get to space completely different things are happening depending on how you played those previous games
36:59
and it turns out because there's four different levels to play and there's three different ways of playing each one
37:05
uh there's actually four what you can skip it which is one of the ways but you can play aggressively which is kind of the mean way you can play uh nice which
37:12
is you know you sing to people and you dance with them or you can be neutral which is your half and half so when you take all of that stuff together there's
37:18
like 256 different ways to play Spore which lead into what space is going to be like when you're all done so I was
37:25
trying to top down this problem and it was just a nightmare like I'm looking at each one of these boxes I can barely
37:32
keep this document in my head of you know this like four dimensional space thing that you're trying to juggle as
37:37
just a nightmare so I knew that it just wasn't working and sometimes when you start working on these onepage designs
37:43
you know your design is bad because you can't make it into a one-page design it just doesn't work right and that usually
37:49
means it's too complex you're just thinking about the problem wrong so um let me see how I'm doing on time here so
37:54
okay so I'm going to walk through uh kind of a step by- step and and show you the process that I came uh that I used
38:01
to come up with this chart so there's a little bit of you know esoteric stuff here um but if you can just follow through and if you get bored along the
38:07
way just look at the pictures and pretend your it's Hypnotoad is talking to you um so here's my first take on on
38:15
that Excel sheet so well what's really going on well when I start at cell in
38:20
the middle there if I'm aggressive um I'm going to say aggressive is the red color dot if I play cell aggressively I
38:27
move up towards the top of the screen and then if I play creature aggressively I keep moving up towards the top of the screen and then if I play Civ and and
38:33
all the way I end up getting a color dot at the very top there which happens to be Warrior so this chart clearly shows
38:41
that if you do everything aggressively you're going to become a warrior um you know not too clear but I love this chart
38:47
when I put it together because it just looks so like I don't know from the 60s like a dream catcher or like something
38:53
like that this Design's beautiful it's elegant look at it it I could put it on a necklace NE and wear it that's how
38:58
cool this design is but it was wrong it was like wrong in
39:03
a lot of ways and it took me a while of staring at it before I realized so first of all it's like what are all these colors around the outside like seems
39:10
almost completely random what's going on there um and I realized it's like the diagram was wrong if you think of um let
39:16
say a Japanese fan you know how you can fold the Japanese fans I had folded the fan all the way around to make it look
39:22
like if you go to the very bottom playe completely blue um along the left side
39:28
are playing completely green along the bottom right side those things appear to be next to each other when actually
39:34
they're not next to each other at all um so the circle was just a bad metaphor even though it makes a nice necklace um
39:40
so if you think of the fan metaphor again like I folded the fan half up I split it and said like the things the
39:45
warrior should be 180 opposite from the shaman and now it's like okay it's not
39:51
as cool as that first dreamcatcher diagram but it's more uh true to what's
39:56
really going on on so now I'm done with this document and everything looks cool I'll I'll print it hang it on the wall
40:03
but it still completely bothered me because of that spectrum of colors running across the top there was just no order to it at all I was like this
40:09
doesn't make any sense there's kind of more red stuff on the left side and more green stuff on the right but every now
40:15
and then you see a green or a green on this side and a red on this side and it's like this shouldn't be you know
40:21
this this isn't how it should be if it was done elegantly and correctly so um it took me a while of kind of goofing
40:27
around with this diagram uh more time than I probably should have spent goofing around with it but I started to get possessed by it um so I started I
40:36
kind of went back and and thought about it of a different way um and what I really realized I'm going to skip over the uh what really happened but
40:43
eventually there's a vector math solution to the problem which is that every time you do something red you you
40:49
get a vector that moves you up and every time you do something blue you get a vector that moves you down to the left and every time you get a vector that's
40:56
uh green that you're doing something nice uh then you go this other way and when you start combining those vectors up instead of thinking of all 256 things
41:03
it actually breaks down to there's only like 36 different things that can possibly happen and U when I made that
41:09
that Revelation I was like oh now I can make this onepage design document I'm going to give it to the programmers who have been just hating me because I keep
41:15
you know change giving them these Excel sheets to import into the program um and I'm going to like clear this up once and
41:21
for all we finally solv this thing and so I wrote up the document sent it out um and again this is a onepage design 8
41:28
1 half by 11 it wasn't a giant post or anything and I just printed out and I gave it to the programmer and a couple other people and said here's how the
41:34
system should work this is very clean it's very elegant and plus we can use an algorithm to solve the problem we don't
41:39
need this huge table that somebody hand typed every little thing into cells uh and an Excel spreadsheet you can just
41:46
run this formula if they do something evil move this way if they do something nice move this way so at that point I
41:52
was like well okay I'm done I should really move on now but again it's like
41:57
there's something like I want to see what this space looks like now that I know that it's this finite space I want
42:03
to plot it out and I want to discover what the the true shape of this problem really was um so I kind of doodled an
42:09
illustrator I made all the different possibilities these are all the vectors that could possibly occur in Spore and how you move around into the different
42:16
space and like guess this kind of abstract what you're looking at here um but I drew them all out not knowing what was going to happen and like that's kind
42:24
of cool it's like interesting kind of Circ electronic diagram or something but
42:29
what if I take their Origins and I push all their Origins together so that everything's coming off zero so it's taking all these different vectors you
42:35
see and kind of shoving them in that middle spot what would happen and I didn't know and I put it all together
42:40
and it's like this came out of it like wow that's like really cool like what did I discover some weird DNA thing that
42:47
was like existing inside this this uh spreadsheet the whole time um and so now this when I finally saw this it was like
42:53
really clear I decorated it up a little bit and printed out a new document and and um this was this became like the
42:59
poster child for this project for this section of the project with the consequences um and it really to me like
43:05
it just clearly showed like what was going on in the game in a really nice easy to understand way now again it's I
43:11
don't expect you to completely understand it because you weren't working on the the you know program with us for you know weeks trying to sort
43:16
this all out but for those of us kind of in the trenches for a while it was really almost like a breath of fresh air and a lot of people are like oh can I
43:23
have that diagram I want to hang it up on my wall even though they weren't working on it because it just kind of looks like fun like it's a bunch of
43:28
Skittles or M&M's you could just eat it you know all right so I'll kind of end on that one um just kind of summarize here
43:36
see how am I doing on time okay right on time so a lot of benefits for writing um
43:42
these documents onepage documents the first are for your team so like I was saying before if you make a design
43:49
document and you give it to one person on your team well shouldn't everybody on the team kind of know about that and
43:54
usually the answer is no because no one wants to be bothered but if you make these really nice clean onepage design
43:59
documents then it's just the opposite people want to be drawn in they ask you for the document instead of you having
44:04
to go out to them uh one thing that you need to know though is that when you make these designs you personally need
44:11
to print them out and hand them to people don't put them in a file and email them the file don't put it up on
44:17
the wiki and say Here's the link to the thing you should click and download and print yourself because they won't um if
44:23
you really want people to see your designs like get out of your chair at least a couple times a day walk to the
44:29
printer and then walk to the people and hand this stuff out and that's the only way you can really guarantee uh that
44:34
they're going to see your designs and I really recommend um face-to-face
44:39
contact UM during meetings when you're going with these things bring in pencils with you it's amazing to me like a lot
44:45
of people don't bring pencils to meetings anymore they bring their laptops to meetings and it's to me it's really sad like you don't have a pen
44:52
with you like how how do you exist got this who needs a pen I can carry around this thing that that runs out of
44:57
batteries that I've got to plug in everywhere I go um why would I want this little thing that fits in my pocket um
45:03
so anyway bring them with you so that you don't have to uh ber rate them for not bringing their own and um give them
45:09
each a copy and actually encourage them to write on these things they're not uh you're not going to hang them up in a museum um they're meant to be working
45:16
documents and you want people to engage with them you want their comments and then you can take that back and make the next
45:22
iteration uh here's an example like so this is you know fresh off the press from Adobe Illustrator diagram that I
45:28
gave to one of our level designers when I was working on Galactic Adventures we had like 64 of these little missions and
45:34
so there's a page for each one of them and so I gave him this one and a couple days later I walked by his desk and this
45:39
is what it looked like this is the scan of that that same thing a few days later and this is what you want to happen this
45:45
is what then you know they're really reading the stuff they're actively engaged in the process and they're
45:50
giving you this feedback that then you can incorporate in the in the Next Generation Um a lot of benefits for you
45:57
too not just for your team um even if your team never reads any of these things um it really forces you as a
46:04
designer to do some work in your head like you know don't just throw out a bunch of garbage and and say you know
46:10
give me my paycheck um you know you actually have to really understand the problem otherwise you'll never be able to make one of these diagrams to begin
46:16
with um it also forces concise design because what happens is you start to
46:22
work on these things and it starts sprawling and the you know the paper gets big and you're just trying to cram stuff and you're shrinking stuff down
46:28
and it just doesn't fit like well is that really important what is the most important thing that I really need to communicate in this document that I'm
46:34
making right now let me re you know I've got to decide tier one tier two and tier three and once I get below say fourpoint
46:41
font then you know just forget it um you know you can only go so far it also like I talked about it
46:47
highlights the relationships in the system so it lets you as a designer as you start putting these things together and drawing arrows and connecting the
46:54
lines you're like oh that has that effect on this other thing oh I see it now where like I mentioned the wiki is
46:59
notorious for chopping up your design and breaking connections between things other than a hyperlink which is is not
47:06
really a real Connection in my mind um and totally AIDS problem solving is the example the long example that I gave
47:12
there at the end um so just to summarize here and then I see how we're doing yeah we'll
47:18
have a few minutes for questions so the goal here of any design of a designer
47:24
and their design that they make is to communicate and idea um you your job as
47:29
a designer is to kind of come up with solutions to problems figure out what's going on and then getting that
47:35
information back out to the team and that's what you need to do and these documents are just a great way of doing
47:41
that yeah is it hard oh yeah it's really hard to make some of these things um it can take a long time but you know like I
47:48
said what are you getting paid for um like got to do hard stuff everything can't be easy all the time they trick me
47:54
cuz when I first went into game design it was like I thought I just got to sit around and play video games all day and then I found out no you actually have to
48:00
work they didn't tell me that in the commercials um and people will read your
48:05
designs uh very you know very obviously and I hope just some of you in the audience as you looked at some of these
48:11
things like man I wish I could see that design I want to see more of that and if you had that reaction then it was a
48:17
complete success because that's the reaction that I'm going for to draw people into your stuff instead of you
48:22
having to like call a meeting and tell everybody what's going on okay so that about wraps it up and uh thank you
48:29
there'll I'll post these slides up on my website ston tronics.com and um that
48:34
it'll be you know in a week or two but if you're interested in uh getting a copy of those then they'll be up
48:41
there all right so it looks like we have maybe about 10 minutes or so for questions if anybody has any
48:49
questions thank you
48:58
so I was wondering could you talk a little bit more about the frequency with which you would update these and did you
49:03
do anything special to call attention to hey here's what changed from last time visually um yeah I usually so it depends
49:11
there's it goes all over the board right um a lot of times what's going to happen is that I'll print out a really rough
49:16
version and of course I'm only showing you mostly the the coolest stuff right I'm not showing you a lot of the stuff that leads up to that but um a lot of
49:23
times we'll have very just early meetings and it's really helpful no matter what level you're at is just to go in with the current understanding
49:29
even if it's just black and white and really simple you know you don't do all the fancy stuff right away and then
49:34
based on that meeting you decide like did people get the idea do they does it need more work did I miss a big section
49:41
everybody was confused about so I don't have a good answer to that but some of them I update that's all I do for a week
49:47
like my job for this week is to get this diagram done and that's basically all I'm doing is like updating it having
49:52
meetings showing it to people until it's ready to print up to put up on the wall and usually once it goes up on the wall
49:58
at that point I'm usually pretty confident that this is like the final design now there may be one or two
50:03
changes um but at that point most of those changes are pretty subtle um and if it is big enough then I'll let people
50:09
know about it yeah and it it seems like you you tackle you you'll go down this route for certain problems that you need
50:15
to communicate out to people like do you ever try to do sort of an all-encompassing here's the suite of one page game designs that encompasses the
50:22
whole project um like I said that's the Holy Grail of this and that's what I'm trying to do in my mind like eventually
50:28
like kind of stretch this limit like how far can I go with this I don't even know I've been kind of goofing around with it
50:33
for 10 years and I pushed it pretty far but I'm still like every time I work on one of these I kind of challenge myself
50:38
to like what can I do differently that I haven't done before how can I push this a little further thanks all right thank
50:44
you hey Stone good talk um couple questions um so in traditional um Bible
50:51
driven design if you want to call it that um it's like you spend a lot of time understanding the design yourself
50:57
documenting the design and then you spend this huge amount of time on a project um updating design which is like
51:03
really horrible um as opposed to communicating with people um in this method it seems like what you're doing
51:08
is you're getting this comprehensive picture of the design and then you're you're compressing it and then you spend
51:14
a lot of your time communicating with people to help them correctly unpack the thing that you've compressed yeah I
51:20
think that's that's is much a higher level thing and that's when I saying when you you have to decide what you
51:26
want to put in the document and so there's kind of this subtractive art going on there instead of being you know
51:31
you put it pretty well it's like instead of being allinclusive you're trying to like really call out the most important things right so I have two questions
51:37
about that um as a percentage of your time even though I acknowledge that your time is better spent communicating with people and helping them unpack those
51:44
ideas as a percentage of your time how much time do you think you spend doing that versus coming up with the design
51:49
and coming up with the document that's question one and question two um what kind of Errors do you see your
51:57
co-workers making

William Playfair
British polymath (1759–1823)

well this is a media lab so I thought I'd talk about media but um I'm going to talk about a particular kind of media
0:08
which is media for thinking in and I'm going to talk about a particular kind of thinking which is understanding
0:15
systems so as an example of that um say you've got some system out in the world such as the planets going around the Sun
0:21
you want to understand what's going on there so you take some measurements you look for patterns you build a theoretical model and that's a kind of
0:28
thinking that we call science it's uh very important kind of thinking but you can also go in the other direction
0:34
instead of going from the system to the theory you can start from Theory and build your own system like a spacecraft
0:40
to take you to a planet and that's the kind of thinking that we call engineering but either way that you're
0:45
going whether you're going from system to a theory or from Theory to a system
0:50
understanding the system is really at the heart of what you're doing so both science and engineering or everywhere in
0:56
between a lot of it comes down to understanding systems
1:01
and media matter because media are Thinking Tools right the
1:07
representations that we use of the system are how we think about it our representations are um how we understand
1:15
this system and what we understand about it and so if we want powerful new ways
1:21
of understanding complex systems if we want to build powerful new systems we need powerful new
1:26
representations and we need a powerful new medium in which we can create and work with those
1:32
representations so much of the way we work with systems today is derived from
1:38
pencil and paper from pencil and paper medium even when we're working on the computer we're still thinking in pencil and paper and I think there's a
1:45
incredible opportunity now to rethink how we think about systems so in this talk I'm going to um
1:53
show you a bunch of different examples of different representations of different systems and to try to kind of
1:59
give hints as to what this new medium for working with systems might be these examples are kind of from all over
2:05
there's like programming circuit design and Signal processing and this and that if you're not familiar with one of these domains doesn't matter you don't need to
2:12
know any of the technical details all that matters is the representations every idea I show here
2:18
can be pretty much applied to pretty much any any domain so I'm going to start off with
Scientific paper
2:24
taking a look at a scientific paper this is a um paper on network theory that was published in nature a
2:30
little while ago very influential paper basically started an entire field of network Theory and it kind of looks like
2:35
a paper right you got a lot of words and numbers and here's a figure and here's a table and there's another figure I'm
2:44
going to read a little bit to you from this paper from the introduction second paragraph where they're kind of setting
2:49
things up the networks of interest to us have many vers with sparse connections but not so sparse of the graph is in
2:54
danger of being disconnected specifically we require that n much greater than K much greater than log much greater than one one or k much
3:00
greater than lular a ram graph will be connected in this regime we find that L goes as 2K much greater than one and C
3:05
goes as 3/4 as p goes as zero and this is incomprehensible um and this is a very
3:11
well-written paper this the authors are excellent writers the what we have here is the authors have a very rich picture
3:19
in their heads and they're trying to compress that picture to transmit over a very low bandwidth Channel which is this
3:26
stream of numbers and symbols right so it's a very lossy compression and we've
Redesigned paper
3:32
got the reader on the other end trying to decompress this picture into their own head and it doesn't work very well
3:38
so I redesigned this paper and my redesign looks a little bit like this so
3:44
you can see words and pictures very tightly intertwined little bit of words a little bit of pictures I'll read a
3:51
little bit to you from this part up here where they're establishing the algorithm that they used to generate these networks that they study we start with a
3:57
ring of nend vertices and here we see a ring of 12 vertices where each vertex is connected to its K nearest neighbors
4:04
here we see k = 4 four connections like so now they're all connected we choose a vertex and the edge to its nearest
4:10
neighbor there's the vertex there's the edge with probability P we reconnect the edge at random there it is reconnected
4:16
we repeat this process moving clockwise around the ring like so so instead of just describing the
4:24
algorithm it's depicting the state of the system at each step so this this is
4:29
what you normally would have to construct in your head here the picture on your head is just Illustrated here they're um discussing
4:37
some relationships the regular lattice L grows linearly with n we see L growing linearly with n we see C is staying
4:42
constant the random Network L grows logarithmically we see L logarithmically we see C going as a reciprocal
4:48
relationship when we read the word logarithmic we don't have to reconstruct that relationship in our head you can just see it
4:55
so what I'm doing here it's it's really just a very simple trick it's to understand the picture that's in the
5:02
author's head and just reproduce that so we're showing the state of the system we're showing the behavior of the system
5:08
as it goes through this algorithm in my next example I'm going to go to a completely different domain
Circuit design
5:13
but I'm going to use kind of the same trick so this next example is um an example from circuit design so here's a
5:21
circuit that I'm working on and I'm not done drawing it so let me finish drawing
5:26
it and that and now the circuit Works
5:32
although you can't actually see it working you can't actually see anything so we kind of have the same problem is
5:37
with that original paper is that the system is doing something and we can't see it doing anything if you were to
5:43
build the circuit on a lab bench you could at least take an aill scope and probe around and see what's going on at
5:49
this node what's going on at that node so you should at least be able to do that so here I'm showing the voltage of
5:54
that particular node and it's simulating real time and we can see what it's doing but you still can't understand the
6:00
system in order to understand the system it's not enough to just see one variable one voltage you have to see all the
6:06
voltages you have to see all the variables you have to understand what's happening here and here and here and here and here and here and normally you
6:12
have to reconstruct that in your head but if I spread these out a little bit
6:18
and switch to this representation now you can see all the voltages across the entire circuit I can scrub over them I
6:24
can see what's going on in this region I can compare any two the one that I'm mousing over right now it Shadow is
6:30
overlaid on all the other plots so I can compare them I can adjust anything in the circuit such as this resistor turn
6:36
it up or down and I see immediately how the behavior changes so we're a little bit further
6:41
towards understanding the behavior of the system but still not enough we're really only seeing half of the Behavior
6:47
now because in electronics there's both voltage and current in order to understand what the system is doing you
6:53
have to understand both of these things so what I'm going to do is I'm going to um replace each of these components here
7:00
such as this resistor with a plot of the current going through that resistor so
7:07
right now each of those blue blocks represents a component this one right here is a resistor this one's a
7:12
capacitor you can see what it is because they have a little badge but instead of just being a um dead schematic symbol
7:18
now it represents behavior and so I can um now at a glance see the entire
7:24
Behavior across the entire system all the voltages all the currents compare all of them I can change anything about
7:29
the system and see immediately how the behavior changes in
7:35
response now this representation here has all the same structural information
7:41
as this you still have the resistor hooked up to the capacitor hooked up to the
7:47
transistor the difference is now instead of just being made out of these squiggly symbols that were designed for pencil
7:53
and paper now it's made out of live data where you can see what the system's doing so so this is a paper about
8:00
Network Theory this is a engineering design using the same trick which is just showing the behavior of the
Richard Hamming
8:07
system so with those two examples in mind I want to step back a bit and kind of talk a little more abstractly about
8:14
what's going on here one way I like to frame this work is with a quote by Richard Hamming
8:20
Hamming was one of the old Bell Labs guys um did world class world class research in all sorts of fields I
8:26
thought a lot about how people think and how people do research and in his paper um the unreasonable effectiveness of
8:32
mathematics he he said this just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot as well as
8:39
sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste
8:45
why then given our brains wired the way they are does the remark perhaps there are thoughts we can't think surprise you
8:53
Evolution so far may have blocked us from being able to think in some directions there could be Unthinkable thoughts
9:00
now Heming was a brilliant guy and he thought a lot about thinking and so what I think is really interesting about this
9:07
passage is that to me there's a really obvious response where Hamming didn't go which
9:14
is to say so um these these sounds that we can't hear
9:19
and these this light that we can't see how do we even know about these things in the first place well we build tools
9:26
we build tools that adapt these things that are outside of our senses to our
9:31
human bodies to our human senses so we can't hear ultrasonic sound but you hook
9:37
a microphone up to an oscope and there it is you're seeing that sound with your plain old monkey eyes right we can't see
9:45
cells and we can't see galaxies but we build microscopes and telescopes
9:50
and these tools adapt adapt the world to our human bodies to our human senses
9:58
right so when Hamming says there could be Unthinkable thoughts we have to take that as yes but we build tools that
10:06
adapt these Unthinkable thoughts to the way that our minds work and allow us to
10:12
think these thoughts that were previously Unthinkable and I'll give you a couple examples of these kind of um
10:18
adapting tools probably the greatest one in the history of humanity is writing
10:25
writing made thought visible writing allowed us to think about thinking um you know thinking and speech
10:33
used to be this really fleeting thing writing allowed us to capture it to study it and um it's widely considered
10:40
that the invention of writing was the invention of reason it was the invention of rational thinking when we had this
10:47
new representation where we could capture thought and think about it
10:52
explicitly and the thing about having a literate culture is that
10:58
um e if you have if you've grown up with literacy you're now able to think in
11:03
this much more powerful way even if you're not writing at that very moment you're still able to think literately that was um that was Marshall mclin's
11:10
deal right you introduce a medium into to society and it changes the thought patterns of the society so writing was
Mathematical Notation
11:17
this really powerful um tool for allowing us to think thoughts that were previously Unthinkable another really
11:23
great one was mathematical notation so I'm going to show you a math problem that was addressed by
11:29
the great mathematician alari in around the year 900 he wrote what is the square
11:35
which when taken with 10 of its roots will give us some total of 39 Now The Roots before us in the problem are 10 therefore take five which multiply
11:41
itself gives 25 and so on and so on and it would be another 800 years before we'd be able to write that same problem
11:48
in this form so there's a a structure that's visible in that bottom form that's
11:54
invisible that's hidden in the recipe and once you take that concept and make it visible now you're able to think
12:01
explicit about it you're able to develop means of manipulating it and the
12:06
invention of this notation is widely considered to be the birth of modern mathematics one reason being that once
12:12
you have in that bottom form you can start to think well what if x isn't a number what if it's X is a velocity or a
12:18
matrix or a member of some abstract group and I think it's really
12:23
interesting that the birth of modern mathematics is considered to be not any particular mathematical concept cep but
12:29
a user interface right so when I'm talking about um
12:36
thinking Unthinkable thoughts this is the sort of thing I have in mind these representations that make Concepts
12:41
visible that used to be invisible and allow us to think explicitly about them allow our minds to go in directions that couldn't go
Interactive Visual Symbolic
12:50
before now in the same way that if you're going to build a microscope it probably helps to know a little bit
12:55
about Optics know how the eye works if if you're going to build a thinking tool it probably helps to have some idea of
13:01
how people think about things and one simple framework that I like is um one I
13:07
got from Dron Bruner who adapted it from p and he talked about these three different mentalities these three
13:12
different ways that people have of thinking about things um which he called the inactive the iconic and the symbolic
13:18
and in modern UI terms they might be called interactive Visual and symbolic so interactive is um is thinking by
13:26
doing by actively exploring performing thinking with your hands being a body embodied in space all that that second
13:34
Channel visual channel is thinking by seeing especially seeing many things in parallel being able to make comparisons
13:40
being able to recognize thing shapes being um thinking with analogies a third Channel symbolic is thinking with
13:47
language step-by-step logical reasoning all that one great example of that first
13:53
Channel interactive is the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick
13:58
so Watson Crick had some data data from rosand Franklin's x-ray experiments and other kind of chemical knowledge but the
14:04
way that they were able to figure out the structure of that molecule is they went down to the machine shop and they
14:09
built these physical models out of brass and wire and they went up to their office and you know tried to fit them
14:15
together and they were ridiculed by their colleagues their colleagues are like hey it's Watson and Crick playing with their toys again and then you know
14:23
10 years later Watson and Crick are like yeah it's Watson and Crick playing with our Nobel prizes again right so
14:29
this the structure of DNA was Unthinkable like literally nobody could think of it they were able to think this
14:36
thought by moving it from the symbolic channel to the interactive Channel where they could think with their
14:41
hands and nowadays of course all chemistry students play with physical models it's just totally standard a
William Playfair
14:47
great example of thinking that second channel the visual Channel 1786 William Playfair was writing a book about
14:54
economic trade balances in European countries and his book was full of these tables and numbers so many exports from
15:00
Finland next page so many exports from Germany or whatever and he had a thought which was you know what would make these
15:06
numbers each to understand is if I drew a map of numbers and so he drew this
15:12
which was the first time anybody had plotted data this was the first data graphic he filled his book with these
15:17
things and invented the field of statistical Graphics so again this was this kind of Channel switch where he
15:23
took something that had been purely symbolic the table of numbers is about as symbolic as you can get and turned
15:29
into something that could be understood in an entirely new way so this sort of Channel switching is
15:36
basically what I'm trying to do here this the behavior of this system can only be understood symbolically you kind
15:43
of have to logically reason like here's what a capacitor does here's what a resistor does stepbystep simulate in your head when we move to this
15:51
representation the structure of the system is still symbolic we still have a symbol for the capacitor symbol for the
15:56
resistor the behavior of the system system can now be understood visually
16:01
and by visual I don't just mean like seeing a plot but seeing many plots in parallel being able to recognize shapes
16:07
being able to compare them that kind of thing so we have the symbolic we have the visual and then we also have this
16:12
interactive Channel where we can um adjust the structure of the system and see how the behavior responds so we can
16:20
have hypotheses and test them out play out what if scenarios build associations between how we're interactively probing
16:26
the system and how the behavior is responding so we're kind of firing on
16:31
all three cylinders here instead of this just being a big pile of symbols we've got the symbolic we've got the visual
16:37
and we've got the interactive and they're all kind of working together and reinforcing each
Signal Processing
16:43
other so in the next example I want to show not just having multiple
16:48
representations but having different representations for the same behavior being able to look at the same behavior
16:54
in different ways so this is an example from signal processing this is a digital filter again don't worry if you don't know what
17:00
that is this is just a system here are some equations that describe how it works and here is one way of
17:05
representing what the system is doing it's frequency response and the system has two
17:11
parameters the cut off in the que and I can grab this knob and drag left and right to adjust one drag up and down to
17:18
adjust the other you'll notice there's something else happening when um when I'm dragging this around so if you look
17:24
up here there's this coefficient KF that's being multiplied and in this representation I have no idea what KF is
17:31
like is it near zero is it near one is it near 100 is it negative I have no idea what the range of number is as I'm
17:38
interacting you'll see that number changes to a concrete coefficient and now I can get a sense of exactly what
17:44
coefficients I'm dealing with over here we're seeing numbers appearing in the equation where before there were
17:51
Expressions so we can get a sense of the the coefficients there up here we're seeing a step response a Time D main
17:57
response and below we're seeing the poles in the zplane that's a frequency domain thing like the Voss transform and
18:03
then over here we're seeing how the for transform is responding so these are
18:08
five different ways of looking at the behavior of the system and as I'm interacting we're seeing all five of
18:15
them responding at once we're seeing these five different perspectives on the system each with its own insights and
18:20
we're seeing how they all dance together as I change these parameters and what this does is this allows you to build up
18:27
associations in your mind so when you adjust the parameter you see okay the poles are
18:33
moving this way which is making the oscillation go in this way and making the peak and the for8 transform go this way you see all these representations
18:40
changing together you build associations between them and the idea is that that
18:46
ultimately leads to what we call intuition the idea that there's some
18:51
desired response I want and I kind of know how to get there because I've seen um when this happens that also happens
18:57
that also happens happens you've seen the system from so many different angles that you kind of you can feel your way
19:03
around it this is a very different way of thinking than traditional analytic um
19:11
you write a whole bunch of pages of grungy equations and come out with the answer way of
19:16
thinking so we need to see the behavior of the
19:23
system we need to see the entire Behavior across the entire system all the variables some once we need to be
19:29
able to interact with the system see how the behavior changes we need multiple representations of the behavior see it
19:35
from different perspectives and different angles something else that we need is to be able to interact with the behavior
19:43
all of done so far and what I'm doing here is interacting with the structure of the system I'm changing parameters
19:49
and then we're just looking at the behavior but you can do more than look at the behavior you can also work with the behavior so in this next example um
19:57
what I have here is an environment for working with difference equations and again don't worry too much about what
20:02
that means but here I'm defining a variable called a and I can set it to a constant and as I move it up and down
20:08
you can see that we have this kind of Flatline plot here because it's constant but I can also say that at each
20:15
step we're going to subtract a little bit off of a and I'm going to set the initial value
20:20
here and then you can see that each step of time we're subtracting a little bit off and we get this ramp going down and
20:28
I can change that constant and get a different slope ramp but something else that's really
20:33
interesting to do is say on each step instead of subtracting a constant I'm going to subtract a little bit from some
20:38
other variable which I'm going to call B and then B I'm H step I'm going to add a little bit of that
20:45
a let me connect these two so they're always the same and what we get is this
20:50
kind of recursive relationship where they end up oscillating so here's two variables I made called A and B and they
20:56
turn into this sign OC mayble Define a variable C which when a
21:02
is positive give me a one if a is negative give me a negative one and now we've turned it into a square wave and then integrate that square wave and when
21:09
you integrate a square wave you get a triangle wave so taking this behavior and then transforming it in different
21:15
ways maybe bring out relationships that are interesting so far I've mostly just been
21:20
working over here on the structure of the system but I can also work over on the behavior so let's say I want to know
21:27
how big this per period is what's the period of the sine wave well I can just click and drag over a region and measure
21:33
it so I dragged over that region I can see that it's about 68 samples wide and you're also seeing something over here
21:39
which is saying the mean is zero which makes sense if it's a full period but I can also look at the max or the Min or I
21:45
can like Define my own reductions if I want to know root mean squ or whatever so another way of looking at it
21:50
selecting regions and then running reductions over them now this period is
21:55
68 samples wide but then as I change this the period is also changing and this selection is kind of going out of
22:01
sync so I'd have to select it again and then I want to know what it is for that so I have to select it again and that gets kind of tedious I'd like to know
22:08
how the period changes when I change this coefficient here so what I can do is over here have a search field and in
22:15
search field I can put in any condition such as show me everywhere where a is negative and now I've got these regions
22:21
I can click on where a is negative it found all the places where a was negative and I can search for anything I
22:28
can find where a is less than b or I can find where a at time n + 1 is greater
22:33
than a at n now it's found all the writing slopes right so what I'm doing
22:39
here is normally called solving called solving an equation solving a systems
22:44
but here it's treated as searching which is a very different way of thinking about it so I want that period so I can just
22:51
kind of Select from one to the other and now it's selected over a full period And I can see that as 82 samples wide
22:58
as I change this coefficient I see that number is changing but it's not really enough to
23:05
just look at that number the width of that I want to see how that width changes as I'm changing this coefficient
23:10
here so all I need to do is draw a line from one to the other and now it's plotting one against
23:17
the other so this is a plot of as we vary that coefficient in the equations
23:22
it's measuring the width and plotting it so every point on this plot
23:28
corresponds to a particular system every point on this plot corresponds to a particular set of coefficients here
23:34
which means that the plot as a whole is not about any particular system but an entire family of systems so we've
23:39
abstracted over that coefficient and we're looking at entire family of systems comparing
23:45
them in this case this kind of looks like a reciprocal type relationship a 1 overx type thing and so one over the
23:51
period is frequency so maybe we should be looking at frequency instead so I'm going to define a new variable here I
23:57
need some sample rate so say 48 khz divided by n and so here's the sample
24:04
width and now here's the frequency of the sine wave and I can plot versus that and we
24:11
can see this has kind of a linear
24:18
relationship so we need to see the behavior of the system we need to see the entire
24:25
Behavior across the entire system all variables once we need to interact with the system see how the behavior changes
24:31
we need to be able to see multiple representations of the behavior and we need to not just see the behavior but be
24:36
able to interact with it to be able to measure it reduce it transform it search
24:41
it whatever makes sense for this particular system and we need to be able to abstract over individual systems and
24:48
look at families of systems compare between them now the next example I'm going to
24:54
show you is about having multiple representations linked together and this is a um a programming example
Programming Example
25:01
actually so what I'm showing here is a 2d vector graphics engine this was
25:07
written by Dan amling who's one of Alan K's researchers and it's remarkable because it does everything that a normal
25:14
2D Graphics engine like quz Ciro does except quz chiro are like Millions lines of code and this is 500 lines of code
25:21
that's the entire code base right there and Dan was able to do this because he invented a language called Nile in which
25:27
which the sorts of operations he wanted to do could be expressed very compactly this is an example of n code
25:35
and the language is really beautiful the algorithms are expressed very elegantly in the language and they're very elegant
25:41
algorithms and you can read the code and have no idea what's going on because you can't see the behavior of the system so
25:48
working with Dan I made it an environment for um exploring Nile code
25:53
and I'll give you a couple examples this first one is kind of a toy program in NY
25:59
and NY is it's kind of like the Unix pipeline it's a pipeline language you put in data and then it a process runs
26:05
on it and feeds data to the next process and next process and down the pipeline um so what you see here we're putting
26:11
Five Points into the pipeline and you see Four Points up there because the first and the last one are duplicated
26:17
and then those Five Points go into this process called make polygon that outputs for beas which goes into this process
26:22
and that process and down the chain and so over here you're seeing a picture A
26:28
visual representation of what's in that pipe and then over here you're actually seeing the source code of the process
26:33
because NY is so compact that the source code for a process can normally just be stuck on the side like a
26:39
caption so what you're seeing at each stage is the data at that stage in the pipeline and if I go up here to um the
26:46
initial input you'll notice that as I point to any of these um initial points you're seeing B's highlight in Black
26:53
down the pipeline so what you're seeing is this point went into the next process and out came this beer and then what
27:00
happened to that beer well it got rounded it got transformed you're chasing a particular piece of data all the way through the pipeline and of
27:07
course I can grab the initial input and adjust it and you can see how the data is changing all the way through the pipeline but I can also do this in the
27:14
middle so if I point to the speci path it's showing not just where that data went but where it came from as well so
27:20
you're seeing the entire history of that particular um object both past and
27:26
future so so this is an example of um representations that are linked together where you point to part of one
27:32
representation and all the corresponding parts of other representations are highlighted bringing them all together
27:38
so that was kind of a toy program in Nile what you see here is the actual rasterization texturing pipeline that
27:44
they use in their system the rizer looks like that and the texturing looks like that you put in beas and outcome spel at
27:51
the end you don't have to follow this in detail but what's really interesting is that you can kind of tell what the
27:57
systems do doing just by going down and looking at the pictures and kind of even ignoring the code you can just see like
28:02
this data turned into that data that turned into that data you notice that there's different types of representations for different types of
28:07
data so this process right here for example outputs a stream of real numbers
28:13
so what's a good way of representing a stream of real numbers well we'll just try a bar chart so the environment tries
28:19
to pick a visualization that makes sense for the particular type of
28:25
data so for the final example I'd like to address the question of how all these
28:32
representations come to be in the first place if you want a medium for working with these representations the question
28:38
of how you create them is pretty Central the thing about visualizations
28:43
is that they're visual we understand them visually that you know that second channel the visual thinking Channel and
28:49
so I think it's essential that they be created in the same way created by thinking visually and creating a picture
28:56
visually is is just called Drawing right we've been drawing forever since the time of cave paintings people have been
29:01
creating pictures by direct manipulation of the picture itself and um
29:09
before before computers that was kind of the only way to do it right so um if you
29:14
were a scientist or engineer you know 50 years ago you had your pad of graph paper you had your um your pocket full
29:21
of pens and when data came along you would just draw it so
29:27
for example you know say I'm um a scientist I run an experiment I get some data I want to understand what's going
29:33
on so um I say well there's a couple of variables I measured which seem to be related so I'm going to plot one versus
29:40
the other as a um as a kind of scatter plot here but the order that these
29:46
samples was taken also matters so I'm going to connect them up with a line and there's there's something else I
29:52
measured which was the the width like a the region that these samples are valid
29:57
and I'm just going to draw that like so and um it also matters whether these
30:04
samples cover the entire space or if there's gaps I'm going to take a highlighter and kind of fill in the
30:10
columns that these samples cover and I can see that um
30:15
there's a gap right here that's not covered by any sample and a gap over here and so on and so there's this
30:22
wonderful um expressiveness and directness in drawing that when you want
30:27
to see something you're like I want to see marginals I need to see my marginals you just go right and there are your marginals
30:34
right and um the downside of this way of working of course is that we're producing this all by hand so that
30:41
limits um how complex it can be and it's kind of a oneoff for the particular data
30:47
set so if we get new data we have to like throw this away and draw a new picture right and you have the same
30:53
problem with computer-based drawing tools like illustrator they're one-offs for predictive data set and so what
31:00
we've seen is that people have turned away from drawing and have instead turned to writing code that generates
31:06
pictures and processing or whatever and working in this very um indirect
31:13
symbolic linguistic nonvisual way of creating pictures so instead what I'd like to
Drawing Dynamic Pictures
31:20
show you is a tool for drawing Dynamic pictures a tool for creating datadriven
31:26
pictures pictures by direct manipulation of the picture itself and I'm not going to go into too much detail here because
31:32
this tool is kind of a talk in itself the tool I have here it's like illustrator it's a vector drawing tool I can draw a line I can draw a shape and I
31:40
can scale it and I can rotate it and all that the only thing that's different from illustrator is that as I do these
31:47
things it's recording a series of steps I drew a line drew a shape scaled it rotated it and so on and these steps can
31:54
be parameterized by data that rotation for example Le I can hook it up to a parameter now when I change the data the
32:01
picture changes so that's the only magic here I have this spreadsheet like data environment and I can hook it up to the
32:08
steps of the picture so if I'm have that same situation that I drew here I've got my
32:15
data I want to um understand what's going on well maybe I'll start off drawing it as a kind of scatter plot so
32:21
I'm going to draw a rectangle over the entire canvas and scale the width by one of the variables and scale the height by
32:28
the other variable and make that a guide and draw a little dot at the end and now
32:35
I've plotted my first point I can Loop that over all the points and now I've got this kind of scatter plot now I want
32:42
to draw that line connecting all of the points so I'm going to draw a line using the
32:49
line tool from the previous point to the next point and now I need to move my little marker to keep track of where the
32:55
previous point was go goes around and I've got this path and I'm going to make
33:00
it a little bit wider and make it
33:06
orange okay and now I um I want those widths those regions that I was drawing before so I'm going to draw a line
33:13
across the canvas scale it down by that width variable and just kind of plop it over here on the data point draw the
33:21
little wings that I had before now I want that thing I did with a highlighter I want to see the regions
33:27
that these are covering so I'm just going to use a rectangle tool and draw a rectangle whose top is at the top of the
33:33
canvas and whose bottom is at the bottom of the canvas and let me get rid of the stroke
33:38
there and make it orange so now I can see there's a gap in
33:45
the samples here and there's this region here that was overlapped by two samples now I'm kind of losing track of what
33:51
direction this is going like whether it's the samples were taken clockwise or counterclockwise Direction so I think
33:56
instead of see lines between them I'd rather see arrows so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw an Arrow
34:02
Head just totally kind of freehanding it here and plop it over here on the point
34:07
and rotate it by some amount which I rotate by should rotate it by whatever
34:13
the angle that line was and so now I've got my arrows kind of chasing around the
34:21
path make it Orange
34:29
let's scale it down so it's not so ridiculous and now the scatter plot dots
34:34
are just kind of getting in the way so I'm going to um select that and hide it and so on and so I drew this picture the
34:43
same way I draw an illustrator by you know directly manipulating the canvas but this is driven by data so if I have
34:53
another data set I drop it
34:58
in I get a new picture I have a new data
35:03
set drop it in I get a new picture or if I just go into the data by hand I can
35:09
just grab this number and kind of wiggle it around and you see the picture
35:15
changing and um just as before if I wanted to add anything I want marginals I just use the line tool and draw a line
35:22
and now I've got marginals direct manipulation of the picture itself thinking geometrically instead of
35:28
thinking algebraically thinking visually instead of thinking in language so this tool can create all the graphics that
35:36
you kind of expect from a
35:45
visualization you can create Dynamic shapes yeah but what's important is that you
35:51
can kind of follow your own thought process and create pictures that never created before in their dynamic R by
35:57
data they can be used as representations for systems in the same way of everything I've been talking about so
Summary
36:04
far so to sum up we need to see the behavior of the
36:10
system if we want a medium a new medium for working with these systems for understanding them in powerful new ways
36:17
we need to be able to see the behavior of the system that's what we can do now that we couldn't do on pencil and paper
36:22
we need to see the entire state of the system across all the variables all at once be able to make comparisons
36:29
recognize things we need to be able to adjust the system see how the behavior responds immediately see how the
36:35
behavior responds make those associations between what we're changing and how the behavior
36:40
responds we need multiple representations of the system looking at the behavior in different ways through
36:47
different lenses bringing out different insights being able to compare them make associations between these
36:53
representations we need to not just see the behavior but also be able to inter interact with it by measuring it
36:58
searching it transforming it whatever makes sense this idea of being able to
37:03
interact with the behavior of the system is super important we're normally over here interacting with the structure of
37:08
the system and that becomes the system so for example when you're programming you're working in code you're thinking
37:15
about code you're you're interacting with the code you're staring at the code all the time the code becomes the program but code doesn't matter what
37:23
matters is what the program is doing and so we need representations where we're
37:28
over here on the doing side we're focusing on the behavior of the system we're interacting with the behavior
37:33
system we're staring at the behavior of the system the behavior of the system becomes what it's all
37:39
about we need um to be able to abstract over individual systems see entire
37:44
families of systems and be able to compare them we need multiple representations that are linked together
37:50
point to one component and all the other components are hooked up we need different representations for different
37:56
types of data and most importantly we need a way of creating these representations that's in line with
38:03
everything else that I've been talking about and I think that means drawing it drawing these representations direct
38:08
manipulation of the picture
38:13
itself so everything that I've shown you so far
38:20
are hints these are nibbling at the corners of a big problem the big problem being
38:28
what is this new medium for understanding systems we need to get away from pencil
38:35
and paper thinking even when you're working on the computer you're still thinking in pencil
38:40
and paper all the techniques we have for working with systems are derived from pencil and paper especially programming
38:46
um programming you're working in a written language written languages were designed for writing in the bottom right
38:52
corner here that's dyra handwriting he handw wrote everything he led ically reasoned about everything the idea of
38:59
visually and interactively exploring the behavior of system wasn't even on his radar he probably would have found it repugnant and that's the Legacy that
39:06
we've inherited so I think we have this opportunity to reinvent how we think
39:12
about systems to create this new medium and I don't know what that Medium is but
39:20
if you like to help find it let me know
39:25
thanks

Abstract:

New representations of thought — written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory.

But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.

Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But it is also enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.
We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.

But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities — all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding — instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.
This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.

0:21
[Applause]
0:38
so since this is Splash this is a programming conference I want to start by um reassuring you that this talk is
0:46
in fact about creating programs
0:51
um I want to start with that because it might not seem like that's what I'm talking about um I'm not going to be
0:56
talking about writing code I'm not going to be talking about building software in the way we normally think about it but
1:01
this is very deeply about creating programs and kind of in the same way
1:07
that we create sounds when we talk we create letters when we write this is about creating programs as a means
1:14
of personto person communication as a means of representing
Personal Background
1:20
thought um this is this is kind of a personal talk in certain ways and so I
1:26
want to start out just with a little bit of personal background so so you can kind of see where I'm coming from um I got my started like you know many people
1:32
you know making games and apps and whatnot um I think I kind of found my stride designing creative tools made a
1:39
number of musical instruments visual design tools that sort of thing that started getting me interested in UI
1:44
design and after studying that I um went to Apple inventing and prototyping UI
1:50
concepts for experimental projects which ended up influencing these things and perhaps other things yet to come and I
1:58
was also very interested in information design I helped Al Gore make a book app
2:03
about climate change designed a series of interactive information Graphics to enable readers to understand things in
2:09
ways that would be difficult to understand and text and then I um I got on a train and
2:18
started Living on the train as a Wandering research hobo um among other things designing new
2:23
kinds of reading material where it's not the author lecturing at the reader but the the author is guiding The Reader
2:28
through exploring Dynamic models simulations that the author has provided the reader kind of has the agency to try
2:34
different things out to say what if to critique the model be more active be a participating
2:40
reader so making these things and then also protyping these different creative
2:48
tool environments for for dynamic things so tools for working with mathematical systems for making software making
2:54
Electronics animation tools for making things that have behavior that do stuff
3:00
and my focus always seemed to be on the representation of that behavior how could authors see what the thing they're
3:08
making is actually doing and what are powerful ways of seeing so they can
3:14
deeply understand what the thing is doing and understand it in many
3:20
different ways so this notion of representation representation of dynamic Behavior seem
3:27
to be very Central and so I made all these things and U made
3:33
all these prototypes and this was kind of hobo period was just you know a couple years or so and then over the
3:39
last year I've just kind of been reflecting on all this this raw material
3:44
and trying to trying to hear what the prototypes are trying to say because all those
Outline
3:51
things that that I showed you know each one of them was kind of individually know sort of useful in its own little domain but that was never really the
3:57
point of any of this like all those were kind of a vantage point to get a glimpse
4:02
of something much bigger kind this new way of working and thinking in the dynamic medium and that that bigger
4:10
picture is what I want to try to talk about
4:16
today so this talk has two parts the first half is about the past and the second half is about the future in the
4:23
first half I'm going to try to make the argument that representations by which I mean the the ways we external ized
4:30
thought have been responsible over the last 2,000 years in large part for the intellectual progress of humanity
4:35
enabling us to think thoughts that we couldn't think before but while these media that we've invented have empowered
4:41
Us in certain ways they've also crippled Us in other ways and we now have the opportunity to design a new medium of
4:47
thought that undo some of that damage that's both Humane and empowering so that's the first half in
4:54
the second half I'm going to try to sketch out what that Medium might look like so what it might be like to
4:59
communicate to work to think in a Humane Dynamic medium so we'll start with
Representation
5:05
representations um what I mean by a representation is the physical form of a thought it's um something out there in
5:12
the world that you can sense with your senses and manipulate with your body and
5:18
um as an example I want to tell you about one of my favorite forms of representation of all time which was
5:24
invented by William Playfair in 1786 William Playfair was writing a book about England trade with other nations
5:31
and he had a lot of data and back then data was always expressed it was always represented in tables of numbers if
5:38
you're doing economics or business or science you had these tables of numbers and you have to learn how to read and
5:43
write them and data and tables of data they were the same concept you couldn't
5:49
tease them apart the data and the way they were representing the data people couldn't think of them separately and
5:55
Playfair had a very interesting thought he realized that there's a certain form
6:00
of understanding that we bring to tables of numbers but there's a very different
6:05
way of understanding that we bring to things like Maps there's kind of a different set of perceptual and
6:11
cognitive capabilities that we bring into play when we're looking at a map and Playfair had the unprecedented
6:17
thought of um making a very peculiar kind of map where instead of left right
6:23
being West East it would be early or later instead of up down being north
6:28
south it would would be more money less money and so he drew this funny kind of map which was the first data graphic the
6:35
first time ibody plotted data and people immediately caught on to like wow this is a really powerful way of
6:42
understanding data um as these things happen it it didn't um people got it but it didn't
6:48
actually um catch on as a thing for another hundred years or so but eventually it did and today of course
6:54
the data plot underlies almost all of modern science and engineering most
6:59
instance of Science and Engineering would be almost Unthinkable without the plot it's just totally fundamental to everything we do to the extent that it
7:05
almost seems obvious right and it's hard to realize that it was only invented a couple hundred years
7:11
ago so the big Point here and this is kind of what I want you to hold through this entire talk what Playfair did was
7:18
he realized that human beings have a certain capability for understanding
7:23
maps for understanding this kind of cardgraphic abstraction and this capability was not
7:29
being used when they're trying to understand data and so he invented a representation which represented the
7:34
data in such a way that this latent capability could be brought into service
7:39
right and that's what representations do that's how they work their magic is they
7:46
draw on certain latent innate capabilities that we have and you know
7:51
capabilities that originally we um evolved for like you know in a hunting Gathering context and um bring these
8:00
latent capabilities into service repurposing them for a more abstract purpose than they're originally intended
8:08
for and you can see the sort of pattern in play in many of the Great representations throughout history in
8:16
mathematics of course one of the first amazing ones was the invention of Arabic place value numerals you can't do
8:23
arithmetic and Roman numerals right you can't think arithmetic and Roman numerals you have to like go over to
8:28
your appus um place value Arabic numerals were the first user interface for numbers that
8:34
allowed calculation to be done on paper this was totally transformative same sort of story with the invention of
8:40
algebraic notation as opposed to like writing out imperative knowledge in Big Blocks of text you could write things
8:45
declarative and um small number of symbols absolute transformative lit's
8:51
notation for the calculus leits was the UI designer of the 17th century he was
8:57
obsessed with notation always trying out um different notations always like talking with his friends about notation
9:02
because he realized that um a lot of the power in idea lies in the form in which
9:09
it's expressed because that's what allows people to think it and in almost any given field you can kind of go in
9:15
there and find a particular form of representation which transformed or ignited the field so the periodic table
9:22
for example M lect table is basically the beginning of a theory of chemistry that's where it all started B's model of
9:29
atom which of course was originally inspired by copernicus's model of the solar system Faraday's representation of
9:37
magnetism as lines of force which influenced Maxwell to make his theory
9:44
although Maxwell did not write Maxwell's equations Maxwell wrote 20 equations and
9:50
20 unknowns kind of scattered throughout his paper it was absolutely a brilliant Theory but there was something much
9:56
deeper there that nobody could see and it was all over side who invented the language of vector calculus specifically
10:04
for the sole purpose of being able to write Max's equations in that kind of compact fourl symmetric
10:10
form so of course that representation of Maxwell's equations has been you know
10:16
very influential but more so heavy side's representation of the vector
10:22
basically powered 100 Years of physics so when you're thinking of the great ideas of History often what you
10:29
really want to be thinking about is the great representations that enabled people to think those ideas so ideas live in representations
10:37
and the representations in turn have to live in a medium so there's different media of thought there's some ideas that
10:43
you can talk about in speech there some ideas that are carried well in song or
10:48
theater but the Big E of course was print the invention of the printing press 500 years ago which basically made
10:54
all that stuff on the left possible all that stuff on the left was basically designed for the medium of print with
11:01
the possible exception of the numerals but even those they've been around for a few hundred years but they're basically kind of a niche thing until print came
11:08
along and that's when they started becoming widespread so a powerful medium is what
11:13
enables powerful representations to be used and seen and spread so you can think about the
11:22
invention of powerful representations and the invention of powerful media to host powerful representations as being
11:29
one of the big drivers of the last 2,000 years of the intellectual progress of
11:34
humanity because each representation allows us to think thoughts that we couldn't think before we kind of
11:39
continuously expand our thinkable territory so you can think of this as
11:45
tied to um you know the the Grand and meta Narrative of the ascent of humanity moving away from myth and Superstition
11:52
and ignorance and towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us I bring this up explicitly
11:58
because I think it's good for people to acknowledge the motivation for their work and this is um this kind of story
12:06
of the intellectual progress of humanity is something that um I find very motivating and inspiring and is
12:12
something I feel like I want to contribute to but I think that if this is if you take this as your motivation
12:19
you kind of have to be honest with yourself that um that there definitely has been Ascent
12:26
we have improved in many ways but there are also other ways in which our history
12:32
has not been an Ascent so we invent technology we invent media
12:39
technology to kind of help us make this this climb but every technology is a double-edged sword every technology
12:46
enables us has the potential to enable us in certain ways while debilitating Us in other ways and that's especially true
12:53
for representations because the way the representations work is they draw on certain capabilities that we have so if
13:00
we go all in in a particular medium like we did with print the the capabilities
13:06
that are not well supported in that Medium um they get neglected and they
13:11
atrophy and we
13:18
atrophy I wish I knew who drew this picture because it's um It's a Wonderful depiction of what I'm trying to express
Tiny Rectangle
13:25
here and it's even a little misleading because the person in the last stage there kind of hun punched over as Tiny rectangle we reached that stage a couple
13:32
hundred years ago right we reached that stage with the printing press and cheap
13:38
paper book-based knowledge the invention of paper based bureaucracy paper based working we
13:45
invented this lifestyle this way of working where to do knowledge work meant
13:51
to sit at a desk and stare at your little tiny rectangle and make little motions of your hand you know it started
13:56
out as sitting at a desk staring at paper or books and making little motions with a pen and now it's sitting at a
14:02
desk staring at a computer screen making little motions with your on on a keyboard but it's basically the same
14:08
thing we've this is what it means to do knowledge work nowadays this is what it means to be a thinker it means to be
14:15
sitting and working with symbols on a little tiny rectangle to the extent that
14:21
again it almost seems Inseparable you can't separate the representation from what it actually is and um
14:29
and this is basically just an accident of History this is just the way that our media technology um happened to evolve
14:35
and then we kind of designed a way of knowledge work for that media that we happen to have and I think so I'm going
Inhumanity
14:43
to make the claim that this style of knowledge work um this lifestyle is
14:50
inhumane and I mean something very precise by that so I'm going to try to explain with an analogy imagine um
14:59
imagine you adopt a puppy so you adopt this puppy and you
15:04
name him puddles you take puddles home and you give them a little snack and you stick puddles in a cage and you lock the
15:12
door forever and never open it again and puddles lives out the rest of his poor life trapped inside this little
15:18
cage so that's wrong I think most of us would agree that's sadistic that's you
15:24
obviously inhumane so well let's ask what exactly is wrong about that you know what what is inhuman about sticking
15:30
puddles in the cage well you know we kind of have a notion of what it means to live a full docky life right dogs
15:38
have to run around dogs run around and they sniff other dogs and they pee on
15:43
things and that's kind of what it means to be a dog they've inherited this this set of capabilities capabilities and
15:49
traits from their wolf ancestors and we recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire
15:56
range of capabilities by sticking him in the cage you're constraining his range of experience you're not letting him do
16:03
all the things that dogs can do and this is exactly what we've done to ourselves
16:09
we've invented media that severely constrain our range of intellectual
16:14
experience that um of all the many capabilities that we have all the many
16:21
ways of thinking that we have we've constrained ourselves to a tiny subset we're not allowed to use our full
16:27
intellect and toce see that I think we need to take a look at you know what is that full range of capabilities what are
Modes of Understanding
16:34
all the different ways we can think about things and it turns out it's it's a very vast and amorphous space our
16:42
modes of understanding so there's been number of different attempts to add structure to that space to carve it up
16:49
one way of looking at it is by looking at the different sensory channels that we use to make sense of things so an
16:56
example um if I say music you'll think oh that's something that we understand arly right but there's another
17:02
representation of Music which is visual which is sheet music which allows us to
17:08
understand music in a very different and very powerful way if you're making music
17:13
then you're often thinking about it tactically it's a tactical understanding it's an interaction between your hands
17:19
and the instrument you could Define dance as an understanding of Music which lives in
17:24
the body which lives in the movements of the body and if you've ever play in an orchestra or a band you can appreciate a
17:31
kind of spatial understanding of Music where you know the guitarist are over there the drummers over there you're
17:36
kind of thinking about music in the spatially distributed way and music is just an example there's
Multiple Representations
17:42
any number of things which can be represented in any or all of these these forms these channels and it's a more
17:49
than the sum of their parts thing that when you have multiple representations they compound and reinforce each other
17:55
incredibly powerful ways and allow to allow for understandings that would not be possible in any single
18:02
channel so that's one um I guess one attempt to draw a basis vectors into
18:07
this kind of space of understandings another useful one was presented by Jerome Bruner kind of adapted from PJ
18:14
theories so he talked about the action-based image-based and language-based
18:19
understandings riding a bike is something that you understand by doing it you can't talk about how you ride a
18:25
bike it's the understanding lives in the Performing of it there an image-based understanding you can look at the drive
18:30
frame of bike and see how the sprocket is pulling the chain over the derailer and you kind of understand this complex
18:36
mechanical system in this image-based wordless way and then of course there's
Language Based Understanding
18:41
language-based understanding understand you can articulate you can talk about parts of a bike you can talk about gear
18:47
ratios and calculate them I think most of us In This Crowd tend to gravitate
18:53
towards the symbolic and so I think it's important you know maybe to to remember
18:59
that um speech is purely symbolic and the most the most um important invention
19:07
in the history of humanity was the invention of writing where he took speech and turned it into an image-based
19:13
iconic second Channel form right so that's what happens when you get multiple um channels involved is you
19:20
lead to um leads to understandings that would not be possible with any any single one I'm going to put up a couple
19:26
others just to kind of um give you sense of the breadth of the space so there's um Howard Gardner's multiple
19:33
intelligences some people abuse this to say things like Johnny is Visual and Sally is verbal or whatever um you know
19:39
don't do that um but the way to use this is to realize that every human being has
19:46
all these capabilities and um we can design representations across them I
19:52
especially like garders because he explicitly calls out empathetic forms of understanding the way that we understand
19:57
other people understand our El understand nature we can use all of these capabilities my current favorite right
20:04
now is Ked ean's framework he's inspired by votsi and it's a little too subtle to
20:09
talk about here but if you're interested in this sort of thing I recommend you read ean's book The educated mind
20:14
because it's fantastic so the point of all of this is really
20:21
just that the space of the ways we understand things the space of our cognitive capabilities is so vast and so
20:29
diverse that even people who have devoted their entire careers to trying to you reduce it down into a neat little
20:35
Theory have come up with very different answers because there's there's so much there it's such a rich
20:41
space um let's just focus on these two for now so basically every every Circle
20:48
up there is a superpower right every Circle up there is a capability that
20:54
we've been honing for hundreds of thousands of years that we use and you know innumerable ways and can combine
21:01
with the other ones in really powerful ways and what happened with the invention of the printing press and the
21:06
invention of tiny rectangle based knowledge work is
21:13
this so all that stuff drops out and we're working with visual symbols right
21:19
we're reading visual symbols we're manipulating visual symbols that's what it means to do intellectual work
21:27
nowadays and you you might think oh okay maybe that was true with like paper and books but you know with computers it's
21:33
getting better right and no with computers it is getting worse so with a
21:38
book you know a book is at least a physical object which exists in the world there's some amount of tactile response you can hold it move it around
21:46
with a book you can make a shelf which is a spatial representation of knowledge it's not a very good one but it's at
21:51
least something that you can understand spatially when you're writing with ink on paper you can move freely between
21:58
drawing imagery and writing in language because the paper doesn't really care what kind of marks you make on it you
22:03
have the freedom at least to move between those two modes but then we invent these things
22:10
and they have these flat glassy screens that have no tactile response and that
22:16
drops out and they're expensive little screens they take up a little tiny portion of your field of view and the
22:23
spatial stuff drops out and they have these keyboards basically it's the only
22:28
convenient V thing to do is punch in symbols especially for us anything from writing an email to writing a computer
22:34
program anything other than just typing in letters is incredibly cumbersome
22:39
regardless of what you're trying to express you express it in symbols because that's what the interface encourages you to
22:46
do so that drops out and so this is the
22:52
cage that we have trapped ourselves in this is the way in which we have
22:58
strained our range of experience which we have created a tiny
23:03
subset of our intellectual capabilities and restricted ourselves to this tiny subset and have forbidden ourselves to
23:11
use our full intellect so there's two things wrong
23:16
with this one is that it's inhumane so in the same way you know keeping puddles in the cage is inhumane because he can't
23:24
do all his doggy things using media that restrict our thinking to this tiny subset is inhumane because we can't do
23:30
all our thinking things we can't think in all the ways that human beings are able to think so that's there's kind of
23:36
a moral argument there if you don't buy that there's also a practical argument which is that is just wasteful one way
23:43
to think about it is you know as programmers imagine you have like an aord processor and you're writing some
23:49
code it's kind of a sequential algorithm can't parallelize it so you're running this code and it's maxing out one of the
23:54
cores and the other seven cores are just idoling right and that that hurts right
24:02
like as a program you kind of get this feeling in your stomach like you know oh God this is so inefficient like if only
24:08
I could parallelize this algorithm like there there's like so much latent power I can draw on and that's exactly the
24:14
emotion that I get when I'm looking at this tiny rectangle based knowledge work that we do is that there's all these
24:21
cores we have all these capabilities and they're just sitting there idle and if
24:26
we could only parallelize our representations across all these capabilities who knows what we'd be
24:32
capable of thinking so the good news is that we now
24:38
have an opportunity to do something about this so we're now at a um I believe unique moment in history where
24:45
we're inventing the next medium of thought after the printing press we're inventing the dynamic
24:51
medium so in the same way there's certain thoughts that can be conveyed pretty well in speech then thoughts
24:57
conveyed in theater or in print there's I believe a very wide range of thoughts that can be conveyed in programs once we
25:05
understand how to do that so this medium that we're inventing the dynamic medium has three very
Dynamic Medium
25:11
interesting properties um one is that it's computational which means that it's capable of simulation you can simulate
25:18
processes out in the world it's responsive so unlike a book where you you poke at the book and book doesn't do
25:23
anything Dynamic things can respond to stimuli so when they're simulating stuff in the world they can respond and show
25:30
you the results in many different ways and it's connected so unlike a book here and a book there they can't you know
25:37
they're isolated objects um Dynamic material can exchange information and talk to each other and so what this
25:44
means if you're trying to represent something like a system today in language if you're trying to represent a
25:50
system you describe it you talk about it that's a very poor way of representing it in a computational medium you can
25:56
model it you can actively model and explore that system and then see what
26:03
it's doing in many different ways and you can start to fill in this we've got a responsive medium and
26:11
you know today we mostly think of computational responsiveness as a visual thing you know you've got a screen and
26:16
it does stuff and some amount of oral responsiveness and I think things are only going to get really interesting
26:22
once we have tactial responsiveness I'm not really talking about haptics here I'm talking basically about taking
26:28
computation out of the screen and into the physical world so infusing physical
26:34
matter with computation and um letting kind of dynamic responsiveness be
26:40
something that exists in the world something you can touch and feel and interact with with your hands the way
26:46
we've been working with tools for millions of years so once we have kind of a full physical responsiveness we can
26:53
start to fill that in and as a connected medium that means
26:59
that if you have a space filled with Dynamic material it's not all isolated they can talk to each other they can
27:05
work together to make large scale representations so we no longer have to
27:11
work with like little things that we hold in our hands but all of the material can host things that are body
27:17
scale or room scale start to fill that
27:23
in and we can start to have the the potential at least to design a medium
27:30
that is Humane and empowering and these are two sides of the same coin Humane
27:36
meaning allowing us to draw on our full range of capabilities getting us out of the cage allowing us to express our full
27:43
intellect and empowering meaning taking advantage of that drawing on our full intellect to enable people to think
27:49
thoughts that they couldn't think before so in the second half of the talk
Sketch
27:56
I want to take you through a little sketch of what it might be like working in a fully Dynamic medium how thoughts
28:04
would be represented in these different modes person to person one toone conversations or one to many
28:10
presentations thing to person things like you know what does it mean to read chire Knowledge from a knowledge object
28:15
or to browse many of them person to thing what does it mean to author this sort of material or to use it as a way
28:22
of thinking so This Is 40 years out as we
28:27
may think or dynabook kind of thing but it's not really intended as a prediction
28:33
so much as just a guidepost to kind of steer the ship towards I found it very
28:38
useful as guidance for my own work and so I hope you'll find it useful as well I'm only going to be talking about
28:45
The Human Experience of working and thinking in this medium um I'm not
28:51
really going to address the implementation of this stuff the the technology that underlies it isn't really the point here but um I've been
28:58
reminded that there are people at this conference who are very interested in technology and I would be remiss to
29:04
leave it unaddressed so here's the part of the talk about technology I'm taking the liberty of inviting in legendary MIT
Technology
29:12
Professor Jerry susman author of scheme and sick p and sick M and all these
29:17
wonderful things and susman is going to tell us about the technology of the future okay but you know in the future
29:25
it's going to be the case that that computers are so cheap and so easy to make that you can make them the size of
29:31
a grain of sand complete with a megabyte of ram you're going to buy them by the by by The Bushel I suppose you can pour
29:41
them into your concrete okay you buy your concrete by a me flop and then you have a wall that's smart okay as long as
29:47
you can get the power to them and they can do something you know that's going to happen okay it's sort of the way I
29:53
said remember indiv your cells are about are pretty smart and they but they seem to talk to each other other and do
29:58
useful things so we have to begin to worry about that kind of a world that'll happen it's going to
30:04
happen because there's no other way to make the future happen so if susman says it's going to
30:10
happen that's good enough for me and as he says we have to begin to
The Engineering Problem
30:17
worry about that kind of a world what he's worrying about in this case is the engineering problem of how do we build
30:23
working reliable systems out of this kind of distributed computational material
30:29
what I'm worrying about and I'm hoping to impress on you as well is the the humanist problem of what should we build
30:37
and why are we building it and what will we do with it and what's what is it going to do to us right because this
30:43
technology they talking about you know this kind of you know 300 computers per square inch or whatever infused into the
30:50
into physical matter that that sounds like really far off right that sounds like um you know we've got time but you
30:56
know technology does the exponential thing and we're always blindsided by exponentials so this technology he
31:02
talking about is going to be here before we know it and so it's kind of up to us to prepare for that you know we have the
31:08
choice to to say okay um let's start envisioning and sketching and pro
31:14
prototyping designing um designing something that we you know understand to
31:19
be Humane so then when the technolog is ready we're like okay we know we know what we want to build with this we know it's going to work we know it's going to
31:25
be good um so you can do that or you can just kind of do the incremental thing and kind of you know jump on whatever
31:32
technology bandwagon comes on and let technology follow its own course and I can guarantee you that that is not going
31:39
to be Humane that result is just going to lead you into a Tighter and Tighter a cage because when technology takes its
31:47
own path it finds certain veins of cap human capabilities and just kind of like
31:52
drills further in those and leaves the rest of the capability landscape untouch
31:59
so um even though it doesn't seem feasible right now I think we need to start thinking about how to design the
32:05
Humane medium with the technology that we want to have so let's start off with the most
32:13
fundamental active communication which is a realtime conversation between two
Active Communication
32:18
people so this is something that we've been doing for you know hundreds of thousands of years um and we do it
32:26
nowadays basically in the same way that we have been doing it for hundreds thousands of years is by um spoken words going back and forth that's how we um
32:33
communic that's how we converse is like spoken words going back and forth um wave our hands around maybe maybe we'll
32:40
like draw some sketches on a whiteboard or a cave wall and um there's some
32:47
things that you can represent well in in that medium and there's many things especially kind of modern things that um
32:54
we need to talk about nowadays which are not well represented in spoken language
33:00
and one of those is systems so for so we we live in an era of systems there's um
33:07
natural systems like the environment ecosystems biological systems
33:12
pathological systems and there's the stuff that we make um political economic
33:18
infrastructural systems um things that we make out of concrete and metal
33:24
electronics and the wrong way to understand a system is to talk about it
33:30
to describe it the right way to understand it is to kind of get in there and model it and explore it and um you
33:37
can't do that on Words um and so what we have is people
33:43
are ex um using these very old tools people are um explaining and convincing
33:49
through reasoning and rhetoric instead of the newer tools of evidence and explorable models we want a medium that
33:56
supports that so we can start to think about a medium
Dynamic Modeling
34:01
a medium for conversation that is naturally show and tell where um depicting and describing are on an equal
34:08
footing is just as easy to create an image as it is to create a description
34:15
and what you are depicting are not static images as we do today but actual
34:21
working models you're creating simulations you're creating programs and um so for example examp if
34:28
you want to talk about how you know in this case how a um airplane wing generates lift if you want to talk about
34:33
the effect of some policy change you know all these things can be modeled we want to have a medium where you can
34:39
model them and then explore them and have that be the content of the conversation and you want these models
34:47
that you're building to be evidence-backed you want them to draw upon the facts and knowledge that we
34:52
know about the world incorporate them into the model and have everybody be able to see the the facts that you're
34:58
bringing in the Providence of the facts everybody see everyone to see how the model is working and so this kind of
35:06
leads to the first um first of several big juicy research questions which is
35:13
how how do we do this kind of modeling because kind of the the way that we create Dynamic models today is with this
35:20
activity that we call programming which is kind of going off and staring at a screen and bashing on a keyboard for a
35:25
few hours or weeks and I'm talking about getting this down to seconds improvising sketching Dynamic
35:32
models in real time as part of the real time given take of a conversation we don't know how to do
35:39
that we don't know how to create working Dynamic material in seconds and you
35:44
might think that's impossible like how can you program in seconds but um that I
35:50
would agree it probably is impossible if you're thinking about staring at a screen bashing on a keyboard um I'm
35:55
talking about something that where it's using all the capabilities of the human
36:00
body and you know we're we're pretty fluent in talking in words and somehow we got
36:07
very fluent in writing and drawing like we can just kind of do that without thinking about that playing a musical
36:13
instrument we can't do that without thinking about it if you've been trained and I think it's will be the same thing
36:18
for dynamic modeling that if we find the right medium then we can do that in real
36:26
time as part of the give and take of a conversation um
36:33
there again this this is kind of a big research question not a whole lot of people are working on it um if you've seen like some of Ken pin's latest work
36:40
with chalk talk he's starting to make the initial baby steps on creating a um a dynamic language that can be used in
36:46
real-time conversation um this what I'm talking about here this
36:51
is not computer supported collaborative work this is not Google Docs um those
36:58
things are about making the old representations more efficient those things are about um sticking with words
37:04
and static pictures and moving those around faster I'm talking about pushing words to the sideline and
37:10
having Dynamic modeling creating programs in real time be the content of the conversation you're modeling
37:16
exploring together with the other person so now we can think about um one
37:23
to many kinds of communication you know obviously VI ly let's get away from this
Working Models
37:29
clicking through a PowerPoint deck or something kind of closer to a Blackboard where we're kind of again kind of
37:35
sketching material from scratch where you can go in any direction um and again it should be dynamic material so what
37:42
you're what you're sketching as part of your presentation is working models and you're kind of exploring them there with
37:49
the audience and they're evidencebased models meaning that conversations today
37:54
tend to be kind of a string of anecdotes like oh I heard that and then you say well I will trust him because he's an
38:01
authority figure or he looks trustworthy or someone else said he was trustworthy and you know so this complex notion of
38:06
trust which is um hopefully going to be obsolete if I am up here building my
38:13
models and you can see the model I'm building you don't have to take my word for it you can see the model you can see the facts and knowledge I'm bringing in
38:19
to support the not model you can see where those are coming from you can kind of see the Providence of everything I'm
38:24
using to support my argument and um you know and you can critique the model you can like check the facts
38:31
yourself and you make all that visible it leads to a very different notion of trust and integrity and this is I think
38:38
a really important part of the the empowering aspect is that um trusting Authority is disempowering giving people
38:46
the um ability to be independent is empowering so presentations in the form
38:52
of improvising Dynamic models that are explored together with the audience but I think the most interesting possibility
38:58
has to do with using the space so right now I'm on a stage and the stage is
39:04
completely empty right there's there's a Podium and there's like a guy and you know big pictures over there and um you
39:12
know it would be nice if I had like you know props that I I could be showing you things but um I don't you know I would
39:19
have had to like carry that in my suitcase I don't have a way of downloading things to the stage but if we have an environment which is kind of
39:26
you know full of dynamic material then we can start to think about actually
39:32
using human scale representations using body scale and room scale
39:37
representations having a presentation where the presenter is kind of moving around and interacting with real things
39:46
in the environment so we can start to think about things like mapping Concepts space to physical space like the
39:52
different topics that the presenter is presenting actually are are there you
39:57
can see them they don't go away the presenter presents by moving their body
40:03
from one topic to another as the argument moves from one topic to another having a very strong spatial grounding
40:09
start to think about things like having the the outline of the talk evident in the space that what I talked about five
40:16
minutes ago is there what I'm going to talk about in five minutes is there it's not just like one thing after another
40:21
after another as it is today so again using the medium to kind of invoke these
40:27
kinesthetic and spatial forms of understanding that are really important so for this um real time form
40:34
of conversation I'm really talking about improvising Dynamic models as the
40:40
content of the conversation of the presentation and exploring them with the other person now we can think about non-real
NonRealTime Communication
40:47
time forms of communication what is the equivalent of a book or website books or
40:53
websites nowadays are basically big piles of words right and so they inherit
40:58
the same problems as speech is in that the authors are explaining and convincing through reasoning and
41:04
rhetoric not through evidence and explorable models and they have an additional
41:09
problem which is that they're one size fits all they're Mass manufactured and so I read a book you read a book we're
41:15
both we both read exactly the same words even though we have we're coming to a different levels of knowledge and we're
41:21
want we want to get different things out of it right and um you know in a dynamic medium that makes no sense so um we can
41:29
start to think about first of all context sensitive Dynamic material what I read and what you read are not
41:35
necessarily the same thing the material takes into account who we are and what we want to get out of this this is again
41:42
kind of a big juicy research question how do you create context sensitive material um many years back I wrote a
41:49
paper called Magic Inc about on this topic of contact sensitive um reading material but there's there's so much
41:55
more there that needs to be done and again the big thing is um explorable
42:01
models so what the the author is sending out to the reader is not a big pile of words but it's a working thing it's a
42:08
program that the reader then kind of actively explores and what this could lead to one possibility is the reader
42:15
getting more out of the material than the author put into it so in the same way that game designers are always
42:21
surprised by what players end up doing in their game and authors of creative tools are always surprised by what
42:27
people make in their tools I'd like to see authors being surprised by what
42:33
readers end up learning from their material because the author is not just sending out something static they're
42:38
sending out a program which is capable of mergent behavior and so the the
42:43
reader will be able to try out different things and discover things that the author hadn't
42:48
intended and when you had this kind of active based reading it kind of brings back in some of the um things that we
42:54
lost when we went from learning through active dialogues with another person to
42:59
just kind of reading a single argument um this allows you to kind of have a more interrogative mode where you can
43:04
have a kind of dialogue with the
43:09
material but kind of like what I said with presentations I think the the most exciting possibility here has to do with
43:16
the form factor um so what I've depicted up here is kind of you know the legacy
43:21
of the printing press it's this kind of flat thing you hold in your hands I don't really think that's what a book should look like in the dynamic medium I
43:27
think a book wants to be a space that you walk around in so something that
43:33
feels a little bit more like a museum Gallery than a book today so you read
43:39
this book by walking around in it engaging again visually spatially
43:45
tangibly using all those capabilities that we've evolved for understanding spaces and
43:51
environments so you want to learn linear algebra for example you download the linear algebra textbook which is this
43:57
entire space Maybe each floor there's a particular chapter you kind of make your way through the book by making your way
44:02
through the space interacting with the things the concepts are represented in tangible physical form you can use your
44:09
spatial forms of perception to understand the gist of the entire material I want to clarify that what I'm
44:15
talking about here is not VR this is not VR it's not AR it's just
44:23
R the Dr if like Dynamic reality it's um a
44:29
real physical matter that you can you can touch but you know real physical matter that offers all the thousands of
44:36
perceptual cues and physical affordances that we've been honing over the last 100, years but it's Dynamic and the same
44:43
way a picture on a computer screen is a dynamic picture this is kind of dynamic um
44:49
physicality so if that's what a book looks like we can start to think about what a library looks like and no surprise I think that a
Library
44:57
library um should also be a physical space that you walk around in libraries today are physical spaces but you walk
45:03
around and you just see a bunch of spines which aren't very useful and so you can start to think about um a
45:09
spatial representation of the entire bread of human knowledge having
45:14
different areas of the space represent different areas of knowledge you can walk into a space kind of just glance
45:19
around and kind of get the jist of some particular branch of knowledge if you
45:25
want to go deeper on something you just kind of move towards it gets more detailed you move towards it it gets more detailed so you have this kind of
45:32
continuous transition between browsing and skimming and engaging deeply that
45:37
you can do again with your body so so far I've been talking about
45:44
um knowledge in this in this medium being represented not as you know big piles of words but as essentially as
45:51
programs as Dynamic models that the reader is kind of actively engaging with and so we can ask the question how do
45:57
you create that material how do you create those programs what does authorship look like in this medium and
46:04
the closest thing that we have right now is this activity that we call programming and um I think that
46:11
programming as we understand it today conflates two very different activities
46:16
two very different things that we've kind of both lumped in with um programming which I'm going to call
46:22
engineering and authoring so engineering is thing to thing and authoring is
46:29
Person to Person engineering is building a working reliable system that meets a
46:34
spec a me measur spec if you're designing a opamp or a hydroelectric Dam
46:40
you have this material that you're working with and it's just really a matter of what is the configuration of my material that you know meets the spec
46:47
it's kind of between you and the material and the forces of nature um so it's that's thing to thing and
46:54
then there's authoring which is person to person authoring if you think about writing a newspaper article or creating
47:01
a picture or something the entire point is to create an impression in another person's mind the thing that you're
47:07
making is just kind of intermediary what you really care about is getting your message from the person to the person so
47:14
these are I believe very different activities and we've kind of lump both of those things into programming and we
47:19
do them both in the same way with the same tools both of them just kind of writing code I think that moving forward
47:26
we need to disentangle those so moving forward engineering might continue using
47:32
Code but authoring I don't think code is an appropriate way of doing that because
47:40
it's indirect manipulation so if you think about a um journalist creating a newspaper article they're directly
47:45
manipulating the words in the article if you think about an artist creating a picture they're directly manipulating
47:51
the ink on the paper um there's something very important about being
47:56
able to directly manipulate the experience that the recipient is going to get right because the author kind of
48:03
has to be empathizing with the recipient and has to um be able to kind of see
48:10
exactly what they're going to experience and so if you're creating a newspaper article you're directly manipulating the
48:16
the words if you're creating Dynamic behavior in a dynamic medium then I think you need to be directly
48:21
manipulating that Dynamic Behavior not going through the intermediary of code but kind of directly manipulating the
48:27
end result so this notion of direct manipulation of dynamic behavior is something that um I and others have been
48:33
working on for some time and you know there's certain threads in programming language research which kind of go back
48:39
several decades but still kind of a niche obscure thing and I think that's also a big important research question
48:46
for this crowd especially it's good to work on developing methods for that engineering stuff but then we also need
48:52
to think about how people are going to be creating Dynamic messages for other people and and I think it needs to be
48:57
more direct manipulation and it needs to be kind of a more um sketchy improvisational mode so getting away
49:03
from kind of the engineers obsession with precision and more towards kind of free
Dynamic Material
49:12
expression so lastly we can think about using Dynamic material to think with a
49:19
mathematician you know eventually prepares their proof for publication but before they get there they're doing a whole bunch of stuff on scratch paper so
49:25
we can kind of think about that what what is using Dynamic material just to support your own thought process you know a lot of what I've said already
49:31
applies because the the representations we use to communicate end up being the same representations that we use in our
49:36
head a lot we kind of think in the same language that we speak in but we can start to think here about the the form
49:42
factors of um of dynamic material like what what is the stuff that we'll use to
49:47
think with and I think that there's there's kind of a duality there's
49:52
certain representations that you want to hold in your hand and kind of inspect from the outside and there's other
49:58
representations that you want to kind of be embedded in and kind of explore from the inside so there's this Duality
50:04
between objects environments and so
50:09
um almost all intellectual work that we do nowadays is flat and intangible right
50:14
it's ink on paper or it's pixels on a screen and physical objects to think
50:20
with um you know we we used to have them we used to have things like slide rules
50:26
architectural models molecular models and these things are kind of going extinct because of
50:32
virtualization that a molecular model on a computer screen is weaker in some
50:37
respects because you can't actually hold it in your hands and kind of think about it with your hands but it's stronger
50:43
because it's Dynamic and dynamic trumps everything and
50:48
so we've been led to more and more virtualization not because we actually want virtualization what we want is a
50:55
dynamic we want Dynamic behavior and putting it virtually on a screen is currently the only way we know how to
51:01
get Dynamic behavior and so that's why it's so important to get things out of the screen Infuse computation into the
51:08
physical world create Dynamic Physical matter and then we can start to be able to think with our hands
51:14
again I think the most intriguing possibility here is the possibility of
51:19
abstract tangible representations so the literal representations are pretty easy right like an architectural model is
51:25
just a house scaled down a molecular model is just a molecule scaled up um
51:31
you know that's that's pretty easy but how do you represent for example an algebraic equation in a form that you
51:37
feel what what is a representation of yal x to the N that that concept has
51:44
always lived in flatland and it's almost Unthinkable like you know how could it be anything other than the flat symbols
51:51
that we've been using so long to represent that um again I think that this is entir
51:57
an accident of history that we've designed a mathematics for flat and we
52:02
can redesign mathematics that draws on all of our um you know physical tactile
52:09
capabilities it's kind of a weird thought what would an algebraic equation look like in a physical object but you
52:17
have to think about the Playfair thing what does reading maps have to do with understanding data they're totally different things but then Playfair
52:23
inventive representation the de graphic which allowed people to use their map reading ability to understand data and
52:31
it's totally transformative and I think it's going to be similarly transformative to draw on our incredibly
52:37
profound capabilities that allow us to tie a shoelace or play a musical instrument or do all the things we do
52:43
with our hands and bring those capabilities to bear on more abstract
Environments
52:51
thinking so lastly the the Dual two objects are environments today we
52:58
everybody works in some sort of environment we work in some sort of room that is in a building that is in a neighborhood and all that is static and
53:06
because it's static it can't participate in work that happens at the speed of
53:11
thought so um today all the work that happens at the speed of thought has to
53:16
basically happen within the reach of your arms because your hands are your kind of only Dynamic um instrument that
53:23
you have and so that's what led to the desk and you know working with papers on a desk or you know objects on a desk
53:29
because everything had to be within Arms Reach but when you have a environment that's full of dynamic material that can
53:36
respond at the speed of thought then you can get away from that and you can start to think about representations that kind
53:42
of take up a large amount of space started to think about a form of intellectual work that involves walking
53:48
around moving around looking around interacting with human scale spatial representations you know taking
53:54
advantage of peripheral vision and space scanning and sense of scale and you know all these things that we've you know
54:01
we've been honing for millions of years um I mean it's it's kind of
54:09
obviously debilitating to sit at a desk all day right and we've had to invent this very peculiar concept of artificial
54:16
exercise to keep our bodies from atrophying and the solution to that is not fitbits it's inventing a new form of
54:23
knowledge work which naturally incorporates the body that that draws on the strength of the body that uses the
54:28
body in the way that the body is always meant to be
My Vision
54:37
used so um this is my vision of a Humane medium of thought this is my vision of a
54:45
medium of thought that treats the human being as sacred that treats these capabilities
54:52
that we've been honing for hundreds of thousands of years as sac treats the physical world and our
54:58
interaction with the physical world as sacred and builds on top of those
55:05
things to continue this Ascent of intellectual progress and enable people
55:10
to think ever greater thoughts you might have a different
humane wont just happen
55:16
conception of what a Humane medium would look like and that's that's totally great the point that I want to get
55:22
across here the point that I want to leave you with is that Humane won't just happen right this is not like sustance
55:29
technology which is going to happen because there's already really powerful forces at play Humane is never a default
55:36
and Humane only comes out of very deliberate and conscientious design work
55:41
if you do the incremental thing and just you know ride the current wave of technology and let technology lead you
55:47
wherever it leads you it's going to lead you into a Tighter and Tighter cage it's
55:53
going to lead to more virtualization more dis embodiment more
55:59
dehumanization and so if you believe in the possibility of a Humane
56:06
medium then um you know it's up to us to kind of fight that Trend and it's up to
56:12
us to make it happen thank you
56:20
[Applause]






Here is an HN discussion about a paper by my mentor and professor and colleage Ben Shneiderman (I'm Don Hopkins). I discussed his Dynamic Home Finder and my Dynamci Zone Finder for SimCity that it inspired. This is another visualization tool that I implemented in the commercial version of X11 SimCity decades ago, which still lives on in the open source version, which I will create a web interface for, and integate with these other visualization tools we are discussing. 

Add a new section to the reverse diagrams document in the list of people whose work inspired it, to tell the story of Ben's DHF and my DZF and the plans to integrate it with Micropolis.

Thanks Don for that mention of the old paper, which is still on the right track. My new paper appeared on line Friday and will be temporarily freely accessible:
> Shneiderman, Ben (2020). Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence: Reliable, Safe & Trustworthy, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,36, 6 (Published Online March 27, 2020). https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2020.1741118

I have spent a year developing these ideas, but the evolution was dramatic, based on thoughtful feedback from the 25+ people mentioned in the Acknowledgements. Speaking at U-W, Stanford, UBC, NSF & ONR and elsewhere helped repeatedly reshape my arguments. All that commentary added to the journal editors’ confidence that this was an important paper, so they fast tracked reviews & production and gave it priority in the publication queue. Please send this link around to your colleagues, where appropriate.

Feedback welcome... Stay healthy... Ben

Woops, due to obscure formatting syntax issues, the link you included didn't get hypertextified, because the line was indented, so it formatted it as code without links. (Principle of Least Astonishment Violation!)
What a great coincidence that you just happened to publish a new version of this paper, and thank you for dropping by and sharing it!

Here's a clickable version of that link:

I love this article! I worked with Ben Shneiderman at HCIL, and when he sent me a copy of this article to review, I was inspired by the "Dynamic Queries" of his "Dynamic Home Finder" demo, to implement something like that for SimCity (the Frob-O-Matic window). [Video and transcript below.]
Here are some of the main points of his article:

Don't label machines as "intelligent".

It limits the imagination. We should have greater ambitions.

Enable humans to accomplish tasks that weren't before possible, instead of trying to enable machines to accomplish tasks people can already do.

Predictability and control are desirable qualities. Give users the feeling of mastery, competence, and understanding, sense of accomplishment.

The "intelligent machine" label limits or even eliminates human responsibility.

If you treat machines like people, you're likely to end up treating people like machines.

Ben Shneiderman called his lab HCIL instead of CHIL, to explicitly put Humans before Computers.

Here's his description of "Dynamic Queries" and the "Dynamic Home Finder":

>Dynamic Queries. These animations let you rapidly adjust query parameters and immediately display updated result sets, which makes them very effective when a visual environment like a map, calendar, or schematic diagram is available. The immediate display of results lets users more easily develop intuitions, discover patterns, spot trends, find exceptions, and see anomalies.

>Figure 2 shows a screen from Dynamic HomeFinder, a prototype interface for real-estate agents that uses dynamic queries, written by Christopher Williamson of UM. Users can adjust the cost, number of bedrooms, and location of the A and B markers, among other characteristics, and points of light appear on a map to indicate a home that matches their specifications. Clicking on a point of light brings up a home description or image.

>Users of Dynamic HomeFinder can execute up to 100 queries per second (rather than one query per 100 seconds as is typical in a database query language), producing a revealing animated view of where high- or low-price homes are found-and there are no syntax errors.

>Our empirical study of 18 users showed Dynamic HomeFinder to be more effective than a natural-language interface using Q&A from Symantec (C. WIlliamson and B. Shneiderman, The Dynamic HomeFinder: Evaluating Dynamic Queries in a Real-Estate Information Exploration System," Proc. SIG Information Retrieval, ACM Press, 1992, pp. 338-346).

https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/papers/Williamson1992dynami...

That inspired me to implement a version of the "Dynamic Home Finder" in SimCity:

Multi Player SimCityNet for X11 on Linux (Dynamic Home Finder / Frob-O-Matic demo at 3:35).

Transcript:

Here's an interesting thing inspired by Ben Shneiderman.

We can look at the ... This is the "Dynamic Zone Filter".

So we are going to set this to be dynamic.

Now it's going to show all the zones, but it's not going to show the ones that don't pass this filter.

So this filter is currently all the way open.

Now we're going to change population density.

This is a two-ended slider.

This is the segment of the population density, from zero to 81.

So everything else will disappear.

Say I'm looking for a home. I want low population density. But I want high rate of growth.

And now, these are the places that have low population density and high rate of growth.

And then you can just interactivally ... So each of these filters out some of the places.

So you can look at ... I don't want high traffic density. I don't want any pollution. I don't want any crime. I want land value to be high.

I'm getting pretty picky. So maybe I'll deal with more people. Lower rate of growth. I'm too picky about pollution. I'm too picky about land value. That's it.

So basically, Ben Shneiderman demonstrated this as the "Dynamic Home Finder", and I realized that SimCity has all these layers of information that it can draw on, as fictitious as they are, to do that kind of real time, interactive, smooth database query.

It's just a much higher bandwidth way to query a database than is conventionally used.

Anyway, that was the dynamic zone finder.

Also: Here's some email I wrote to Ben about this article, after re-reading the article again in 2009:

Date: 28/02/2009 18:51 Subject: Re-reading "Beyond Intelligent Machines"

A long time ago, you sent us (me, Brad Myers, Jack Callahan and Mark Weiser) a preview of your IEEE Software article "Beyond Intelligent Machines", which I ran across and have re-read.

It's still delightful, inspiring and relevant today.

Speech synthesis and recognition has come a long way, to the point where the "talking car" scenario is quite common (TomToms that speak and recognize street names and addresses).

But I think the development of user-customizable user interfaces has been dreadfully stalled since HyperCard died.

An "Interactive Learning Environment" is a great description of what I'm developing SimCity into.

Remember when you visited CMU and I showed you the version of SimCity with the dynamic query feature, an "homage" to your Dynamic Home Finder? You could dial a series of filters on spatial properties like population density, pollution, traffic, land value, police coverage, etc. That code is now open source, and I'm redeveloping it!

It's now very easy to write Python code to dynamically query and filter the map and data layers, and visualize with transparent colored tiles and pixel overlays, depending on arbitrary Python functions over the state of the map and its data layers.

And it's also possible to script agents in Python!

Here's a picture of SimCity with the traffic overlay enabled (showing yellow/orange/red haze over high traffic areas), with some PacMan agents, which are programmed to follow roads, go towards high traffic and eat the cars! Notice the clear road behind each PacMan!

let's take a look first at dynamic
0:12
queries and again the principle is to
0:15
visually demonstrate the query
0:17
components and the results and provide
0:20
rapid and immediate feedback for that
0:23
I'll take a look at the demo here on
0:26
this display just move over to the side
0:29
here and we see on it a map of the
0:33
Washington DC area with the Potomac here
0:35
and this is an improved version of where
0:39
we were a year ago in terms of dynamic
0:42
Homefinder
0:43
the scenario I present to you is that
0:46
we're coming up on the new
0:48
administration and you've taken a job
0:50
with the Clinton administration and your
0:53
spouse is going to be working at the
0:54
University of Maryland you're looking
0:56
for a home so the first thing to do is
0:59
to mark where you want to work here at
1:01
the University of Maryland write about
1:03
let's say there be a marker and then
1:07
your spouse is gonna work downtown in
1:09
the executive office building write
1:11
about over there as the B marker okay
1:14
and now each of these points of light on
1:17
the display represent a home for sale
1:21
and if I move to the right I can control
1:24
this display by choosing the distance
1:29
that I want to be from point a and now
1:31
it's set at 30 miles and I'm going to
1:34
bring it down and you can control
1:36
rapidly incrementally and reversibly the
1:40
distance that you wish to be from point
1:42
A so let's say you decide you see
1:45
there's plenty of them so you say you
1:46
want to be let's say five miles from
1:48
work so that you could let's say bike to
1:51
work and now you want to be somewhere
1:54
inside that range from B so you slide
1:58
down and we now can see the set and this
2:01
is looks like we've got about 40 or 50
2:03
homes over there if I now choose about
2:07
the number of bedrooms I really want
2:08
three or four bedrooms so I move this
2:11
double box slider to be
2:13
three or four I've still got about 30
2:15
houses on the display so why don't we
2:18
look at the price now and we want to
2:21
keep the price down let's say about a
2:23
hundred seventy thousand between 140 and
2:26
170 thousand and that's given us a set
2:29
of about a dozen here we could trim a
2:32
little further by choosing we can choose
2:35
from houses townhouses or condominiums
2:37
let's eliminate the townhouses and
2:39
condominiums so we're selecting only
2:42
houses yellow indicates selected fields
2:44
and I can see now I've got about ten of
2:47
them if I click on any one of those
2:48
points if I just click here then the
2:52
bottom of the display gives me a
2:53
description of that house in Takoma Park
2:57
a newer middle-class neighborhood
2:59
colonial brick and fireplace garage etc
3:03
this gives you a way of posing a very
3:06
specific query seeing the feedback
3:08
immediately and getting an answer to
3:11
your question plus reformulating your
3:14
goals as you see the results of this
3:16
query now another way to use this
3:19
display is to explore and here if you
3:22
see the whole area of Washington and you
3:24
want to see different neighborhoods and
3:27
let's look for high price

5 points by DonHopkins on March 27, 2016 | parent | context | favorite | on: Direct Manipulation: A Step Beyond Programming Lan...

Ben Shneiderman has made a career of performing controlled experiments, measuring the efficacy of different techniques, comparing them to each other in different contexts, and teaching his students the importance of empirical testing, balanced with human centered design. [1]
He and Ike Nassi developed a goto-less visual programming technique called the Nassi-Shneiderman diagram [2]. He not only studied and summarized the status quo of flowcharting, but also conducted experiments that suggested flowcharts were not helpful for writing, understanding, or modifying computer programs.

He's also done a lot of work with information visualization [3], including tree maps and dynamic query sliders, and developed systems and published papers that have inspired many other people.

He and Christopher Williamson developed and empirically evaluated dynamic query sliders in the ingenious Dynamic Home Finder [4], which applies direct manipulation and infovis techniques to dynamic real time visual real-estate database queries. That inspired me to implement a similar real time information visualization technique in SimCity [5].

By studying, measuring, comparing, and generalizing on what was really going on, he came up with these eight golden rules for interface design:

1) Strive for consistency. Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations...

2) Enable frequent users to use shortcuts. As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to reduce the number of interactions...

3) Offer informative feedback. For every operator action, there should be some system feedback...

4) Design dialog to yield closure. Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end...

5) Offer simple error handling. As much as possible, design the system so the user cannot make a serious error...

6) Permit easy reversal of actions. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone...

7) Support internal locus of control. Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds to their actions. Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.

8) Reduce short-term memory load. The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires that displays be kept simple, multiple page displays be consolidated, window-motion frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.

Abstract
We designed, implemented, and evaluated a new concept for
visualizing and searching databases utilizing direct manipulation
called dynarruc queries. Dynamic queries allow users to formulate
queries by adjusting graphical widgets, such as sliders, and see the
results immediately. By providing a graphical visualization of the
database and search results, users can find trends and exceptions
easily. User testing was done with eighteen undergraduate students
who performed significantly faster using a dynamic queries interface
compared to both a natural language system and paper printouts. The
interfaces were used to explore a real-estate database and find homes
meeting specific search criteria.
1 Introduction and Background
Most database systems require the user to create and formulate
a complex query, which presumes that the user is familiar with the
logical structure of the database (Larsson, 1986). The queries on a
database are usually expressed in high level query languages such as
SQL. This works well for many applications, but it M not a fully
satisfying way of finding data. For naive users these systems are
difficult to use and understand, and they require a long training
period (Kim, Korth, & Silberschatz, 1988).
Clearly there is a need for easy to use, quick and powerful
query methods for database and information retrieval, Direct
manipulation has proved to be successful for other applications such
asdisplay editors, spreadsheets, computer aided desigrr/manufacturing
systems, computer games and graphical environments for operating
systems such as the Apple Macintosh (Shneiderman, 1983). Direct
manipulation interfaces support:
● Continuous visual representation of objects and actions
of interest.

. Physical actions or labeled button presses instead of
complex query syntax.
● Rapid, incremental, reversible operations whose results are
immediately visible.
● Layered or spiral approaches to learning that permit usage
with minimal knowledge.
One of the great advantages of direct manipulation is that it
places the task in the center of what users do. Rutowski (1982)
describes It as: “The user is able to apply intellect directly to the task;
the tool itself seems to disappear.” The success of direct manipulation
can be understood in the context of the syntactic/semantic model
which describes the different levels of understanding that users have.
Objects of interest are displayed so that actions are directly in the
high level semantic domain. Users do not need to decompose tasks
into syntactically complex sequences. Thus each command is a
comprehensible action in the problem domain whose effect is
immediately visible. The closeness of the command action to the
problem domain reduces user problem-solvmg load and stress.
For information retrieval and database exploration, there have
been several attempts to use direct manipulation and escape some of
the pitfalls of contemporary boolean systems (Zloof, 1975; Kim,
Korth, & Silberchatz. 1988; Williams, 1984). The first two systems
do not provide any visual display of actions. Zloo~s Query-byExample relies on users entering values with a keyboard. Even
though Kim, et al.’s PICASSO supports input through mouse and
menus, it requires users to perform a number of operations in each
step. The combination of graphical input/output is not applied in any
of these systems.

Dynamic Queries 2
Other solutions have come about with the invention of naturallanguage query systems. Some of these systems (Salton and McGill,
1983; Harman and Candela, 1990), usually using statistical ranking
and/or relevance feedback, do afine job retrieving textual information.
They are, however, very awkward to apply to graphical information
systems and they have other well-documented problems (Helander,
1988). An alternative database interface utilizing dynamic queries
(Ahlberg, Williamson& Shneiderrnan, 1991 ) would:
● represent the query graphically,
● provide visible limits on the query range,
● provide a graphical representation of the database
and the query result,
● give immediate feedback of the result during every
query adjustment, and
● allow novice users to begin working with little
training, but still provide expert users with
powerful features.
With dynamic queries, the query is represented by a number
of sliders (Figure 1). Each slider consists of a label, a field indicating
its current value, a slider bar with a drag box and a value at each end
of the slider bar indicating minimum and maximum values. Sliding
the drag box with the mouse changes the value of the slider. Clicking
with the mouse on the slider bar increases or decreases the value one
step at a time. The database is represented on the screen in graphical
form This paper describes a program dealing with real-estate and,
accordingly, the map of the area was chosen as the representation.
The result of the query can then be highlighted by coloring, changing
points of light, marking of regions, or blinking.
The combination of a graphical query and graphical output
fits well into the principles of direct manipulation. The slider serves
as a metaphor for the operation of entering a value for a field in the
query. Norman (1988) promotes the use of sliders since they also
provide a mental model of the range. Changing the value is done by
a physical action - sliding the drag box with a mouse - instead of
entering the value by keyboard. By sliding the drag box back and
forth and getting real-time updates of the query results, it is possible
to do dozens of queries in just a few seconds. The operation is
incremental and, if the query result is not what users expected, the
operation is reversible by just sliding the drag box in the opposite
direction. Error messages are not needed - there is no such thing as
an ‘illegal’ operation or as yntax error.
The interaction between the database visualization and the
query mechanism is important. The sliders have to be placed close to
the visual presentation to reduce eye movement. The highlighting of
elements should be in harmony with the coloring scheme of the
slider. For example the color of the area to the left of the drag box on
the slider bar is the same as the highlighted elements in the
visualization, because the values to the left of the drag box are the
values that satisfy the query.
2 Dynamic Queries Interface to Real-Estate
The program used for the experiment applied dynamic queries
to real-estate. Finding a home is a laborious task for those that have
experienced it. The two most common methods currently used are
paper and SQL-like database systems. Newspaper and printed
listings have survived to still be the most common means for finding
a home. These provide little organization, short of being sorted by
one field, but are easy-to-use for the novice. In the last few decades,
SQL-like systems have appeared to support more complex queries.
Unfortunately, SQL-like systems require training and/or an
intermediary; almost none allow the actual homebuyer to perform
the search. Further, these systems suffer the problems of most
command-line query systems: slow, difficult to use, little feedback,
nonreversible, and too many boolean logic errors. In addition, these
systems offer no easy way to specify locations. The homebuyer must
know neighborhood names, and attempt to figure out if a given
neighborhood is near where they wish to live. Finally, these systems
suffer from the classic all-or-nothing phenomenon. This commonly
occurs when the searcher does not know the contents of the database
(as is usually the case in real-estate) and therefore attempts a query
that is too general or too restrictive. As a result, the homebuyer
alternates between too many and too few results - frantically and
laboriously guessing towards the middle to produce a reasonable set
of homes. Recently, good natural-language query systems, such as
Q&A by Symantec, have been developed in response to complaints
about SQL that instead allow queries to be stated in English. This
should reduce training with syntax and help novice users, but it does
little to correct the other faults of previous query systems.

Dynamic Queries 3
The dynamic queries interface (Figure 2) provides a
visualization of both the query formulation and corresponding
results. This application was built using the C programming language.
A map of the District of Columbia area is displayed on the left. The
homes that fulfill the criteria set by the user’s current query are shown
as yellow dots on the map. Users perform queries, using the mouse,
by setting the values of the sliders and buttons in the control panel to
the right. The query result is determined by ANDing all sliders and
buttons.
The dynamic homefinder interface is best explained through
an example. Take a hypothetical situation where a new professor,
Dr. Jones, has just been hired by the Umversity of Maryland. She
might encounter this tool in a touchscreen kiosk at a real-estate office
or at the student union. She selects the location where she will be
working by dragging the ‘A’ on the map. Next. she selects where her
husband will be working. downtown, near the capitol, by dragging
the ‘B’. Figure 2 shows the interface after Dr. Jones has dragged the
‘A’ and ‘B’ indicators to her desired locations (the indicators are
more visible in Figure 4).
340
Dr. Jones would like to nde her bicycle to work. if
possible, so she sets the ‘Distance to A’ slider on the right to 5 miles
or less. This is indicated by the highlighted region of the slider now
indicating from O-5 miles. Her husband is taking the Metro, so the
distance to his office is not very important. Figure 3 shows how the
screen looks after she has adjusted the ‘Distance to A slider. Note
that this is done instantaneously in a fluid-like manner as she moves
which cannot be captured with snapshots. but which enables her to
quickly see how homes are eliminated as she narrows the distance
requirement.
Figure 3. HomeFinder with all homes within a 5-rode radms
of the ‘A’ marker displayed.
Dr. Jones is only interested in houses, not in apartments or
condominiums so she toggles those buttons off. Finally, she drags
the bedrooms slider down to 4. since she needs at least four bedrooms,
she could have more (for a guest room or study for example), again
indicated by the highlighting in Figure 4 showing that houses with 4-
7 bedrooms are now being displayed. In Figure 4, she also drags the
cost slider to $140.000, a modestly-priced home where she used to
live. Here we encounter the all-or-nothing phenomena as Dr. Jones
has eliminated too many houses with her query. This is easily solved
as she realizes that houses must be more expensive in this area. Dr.
Jones drags the cost slider up to $220,000 in Figure 5, a price that
many more houses in the area fulfill.
Finally, yrst out of curiosity, Dr. Jones chcks on the ‘Garage’
button in Figure 6 only to find that few houses have a garage in the
price range and area she M looking at. Once she has narrowed her
query, lt is easy for Dr. Jones to experiment. seeing what services the
homes offer, or what is available if she was willing to pay a little
more, and soon. In this way the interface encourages exploration and
bolsters user confidence.
Although there is no figure depicting it, a mouse click on any
of the homes (represented by the yellow dots) brought up a pop-up
window with detailed information on that specific home.

3 User Experiment
This experiment compared three different interfaces for
database query and visualization: a dynamic queries interface, a
natural language query system known as ‘Q&A’, and a traditional
paper listing sorted by several fields. The alternative interfaces were
chosen to find out how dynamic queries would fare against the two
most common methods currently used to search real-estate databases.
Using a within-subjects counter-balanced design, subjects answered
a series of five types of questions for each of the three interfaces were
presented in random order. The independent variable in the experiment
was the type of interface with three different treatments: dynamic
queries (DQ), natural language retrieval (QA), and paper listings
(Paper). The observed dependent variables were time to find correct
answer for each of five questions and the subjective satisfaction with
each interface.
The primary hypothesis was that the dynamic queries interface,
providing both a graphical query input and a graphical visualization
of the search result. would give the best user performance results and
would berated highest in user satisfaction. Performance results were
measured as the time until correct answer for each question.
Eighteen undergraduate psychology students, 9 females and
9 males from the University of Maryland subject pool, participated
voluntarily in the experiment. Only one subject had previous
knowledge of real-estate in the area. Both computer interfaces were
run on an IBM PS/2 model 70 ( 16 MHz 80386) with a 12-inch VGA
color monitor and mechanical two-button mouse. All interfaces
Dynamic Queries 5
involved querying information on 944 imaginary homeswith varying
criteria from real-estate in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area.
Although using real home-seekers would be ideal, a reasonable
compromise was made by using novices with varying backgrounds.
3,1 Dynamic Queries interface (DQ)
This interface was already described in detail under section
1.2. As shown previously in Figure 4, it is possible to drag the ‘A’
icon to a certain location where the homebuyer might work, for
example. When the dntance slider is moved to 5, all houses within
5 miles of that location are then highlighted. However, these distance
sliders and the ‘A’ and ‘B‘ icons on the map were not used in the
experiment, since the other two interfaces could not provide this
service.
3.2 Natural language query interface (QA)
The natural language query interface (Figure 7) used was the
‘Intelligent Assistant’ of a popular commercial package from
Symantec, Inc. known as ‘Q&A’. This software allows users to pose
queries using English. The user types the English query, the system
converts it into a logical database query (Figure 7), and then displays
the information requested (Figure 8). A 386 machine with hard disk
was used so the search time was only a few seconds, fast enough that
computation speed was not a significant factor. No graphical output
was provided, a textual listing of the homes that satisfied the query
were displayed as shown in Figure 8.

There were three sets of laser-printed paper listings in
approximately 11-point Courier font, one sorted by cost. one by the
number of bedrooms, and one alphabetically by the neighborhood
name. Each 10-pagelisting contained all the information on eachof
the 944 homes, one-per-line, as shown in Figure 9.

3.4 Experiment procedure and tasks
A counter-balanced within-subjects design was used. The
question sets were always given m the same order, and the interface
order was random. The subjects were given a brief description of the
tasks and were asked to sign a consent form. Each session lasted an
hour and consisted of four phases for each interface condition:
1 lntMductzon and training: The experimenter set up the
appropriate interface and briefly explained the interface to the
subject. The subject was invited to try-out the system and get
comfortable with it. Subjects were permitted unlimited time to tryout using the system and were free to ask any questions to the
experimenter about the interface. Actual training time varied from
two to ten minutes for each subject. The QA interface required
significantly more training due to its less obvious querying mechanism.
Subjects were informed onthemorecomplex sorting and set operations
available m the QA interface.
2. Practice task: A practice task (similar to the complex query
question used) was given. During this task, subjects were free to ask
questions about both the task and the interface.
3. Timed tasks: Five questions were given on paper. Subjects
read each question and were asked if they fully understood it. This
was done so as to eliminate variations in subject comprehension
speed. When the subject was ready, the experimenter started timing.
When subjects found the answer, they verbally expressed it. If it was
correct, the experimenter recorded the elapsed time; if not, the
experimenter asked the subject to try again. The interface was
returned to its initial state between each question.
In deciding the tasks, an informal task analysis was done by
asking a local realtor and a few clients what types of questions they
would ask a database. The first two are very general, while the final
three are probably more representative of ‘typical’ home-searches:
● Simple fact - Find a certain element fulfilling a simple
criteria. An actual question of this type is “What is the cost of the
cheapest apartment in the database?”
● Simple neighborhoodfact search - Find the neighborhood
(city) fulfilling a simple criteria. An actual question of this type is
“What neighborhood has the most expensive houses?”
● Complex search - Find one or more elements meeting several
criteria. This is the typical type of question a prospective homebuyer
would likely ask. An actual question of thm type is “What is the
address of the cheapest house that has 5 or more bedrooms AND has
both a garage and central air conditioning?”
● Find a trend - Find the trend for some field. This task
requires subjects to create mental picture of how a field changes
through the database. An actual question of this type is “Is there a
general trend (and if so what is it) of k prices from cheapest to
most expensive? (i.e. where are the more expensive houses, and
where are the cheapest houses, do they seem to follow any general
pattern?) Don’t guess, you must find some examples to support your
answer. ”
● Find e.xceptlon to trendlComplex search - Find the exception
to a trend in the database. This is, in fact, often what homebuyers are
looking for. An actual question of this type is “There is a trend of
houses to increase in cost with the number of bedrooms. Find the two
bargain homes with the most bedrooms but are still inexpensive.”
4. Subjective e~’aluatzon: Subjects were asked to fill-out a
shortened QUIS (Chin, Diehl, & Norman, 1988) after having
completed each interface. Although results for each of the 20
questions (scored on a 7-point scale) were computed, the sum score
for each interface (out of a maximum possible of 140) is what is
presented in the results section.
4 Experiment results
The results show a statistically significant difference for the
dynamic queries interface over both the other two for all but one task.
Analysis of the timed tasks was done using a factorial analysis of
variance. An ANOVA showed no significant order or questionnaire
difficulty effect (these two were compounded to one factor) with
F(2,51) = 1.17 (p> .05). This, therefore, also shows that there was
no significant difference between the three question sets used.
Observing the mean times to complete each task shows a significant
effect. The mean and standard deviations (in seconds) for each
question and interface are shown in Table 1 along with the ANOVA
and post-hoc analysis. The results for the QUIS are ratings out of a
maximum possible of 140. These means, along with 95 Yo error bars
are graphed for comparison in Figure 10.

The primary hypothesis that the dynamic queries interface
would give the best user performance results is supported in the
results with a significant difference (p < .005) in speed, favoring
dynamic queries. for all but one task. The dynamic queries interface
also scored significantly higher on the satisfaction questionnaire.
Surprisingly, for all but one task, paper was also better than the QA
interface, although often not by a significant amount. The remarks
given by the subjects and comments noted by the experimenter
suggest several reasons why the dynamic queries interface faired
better.
First, the dynamic queries interface was clearly the most
‘fun’, most likely due to its animated graphical nature, and this may
have produced a motivational factor. The QUIS clearly indicated a
preference for DQ ( 110) over QA (68) and Paper (84), with subjects
rating DQ an average of 6.1 on a range from 1 to 7. Many subjects
became very frustrated with the QA interface, attempting to figure
out how to form a query (this is discussed more later). One subject
remarked: “What the hell does this thing want, anyway?” Subjects
seemed very comfortable with paper and usually attacked the question
in a logical fashion, utilizing the sorted paper listings to their
maximum benefit. The DQ interface was clearly preferred by the
sighs of relief and the relaxed manner with which they formed
queries. One subject said “I don’t want to stop, this is fun!”
Question 3:
Complex Search
Question 4:
Find Trend
Muitiple Search
Second, the well-known issue of text readability may partially
explain the success of both the DQ and paper interfaces. ‘Although
a VGA monitor was used, several subjects noted that it was easier to
search the laser-printed listings than a listing on-screen using the QA
interface. Subjects using the DQ interface rarely actually looked at
the textual reformation on a specific home. One subject noted on
their evaluation of QA that it “takes a while for your eyes to adjust
to the small print.”
Third, the subjects clearly had semantic difficulties with the
QA interface. Grammatical, spelling, and typographical errors
where made in query formulation. The QA’s processor often
resulted in unexpected queries. One common error was asking:
“What is the cheaper house?” when the user meant “cheapest house.”
QA did not see the singular house and figure out that cheapest was
actually what was desired. instead producing a listing of all houses
with cost less than the average price. This is even more surprising
since 9 out of the 15 task questions could actually be typed in literally,
word for word, and QA would produce the correct answer. Clearly
subjects spent a lot of mental effort trying to formulate the query,
probably more than was necessary.
344
Dynamic Queries 8
Fourth, the subjects clearly had problems with the classic
boolean query problems. Specifically, they asked for ANDs which
QA interpreted as a literal AND when OR was actually what the user
wanted. Further, subjects often had problems with inclusion, such as
specifying “more than 5 bedrooms” when they actually wanted”5 or
more bedrooms.”
Fifth, the number of ordinary typos was tremendous. Further,
the editor in QA was quite poor, not allowing the user to edit the
previous query without retyping it in. This led to much of the time
spent typing in queries, which for most non-computer people is a
slow process. Occasionally QA would not even report a typo,
resulting in a query that failed, not due to the logic, but due to a typo.
The subject would therefore think their query had failed and would
consequently try another approach to the question.
Sixth, the QA interface often produced the correct answer but
the subject missed it. Subjects expressed they were unsure if they had
asked the right query to get the result and were unsure if it was
therefore the correct answer. A few subjects tried multiple approaches
and only answered when they got the same answer using each
approach. A possible explanation may be that the subjects get so
caught up in the query formulation they forget exactly what they
were originally looking for. This fmstrating feeling of being lost and
unsure was not expressed with either of the other two interfaces.
Finally, the DQ interface’s use of highlighting and display on
one single screen was clearly a benefit for users. They were able to
easily input the query with the sliders. Not one of the subjects
showed any difficulty in using the sliders effectively. One subject
explained the feeling well: “You can see them right up front.. they ‘re
right there.” The display of the results on a map made task 4 (finding
a trend) clearly easier since the relative location could be viewed
directly on the map, instead of having to refer to it from the city, state
information.
The clear benefit of dynamic queries, parhcularly for trend
and exception to trend questions is clear. The significant differences
(F=29.4 and 19.5 respectively) for tasks 4 and 5 are dramatic. The
fact that a time limit was placed at four minutes, probably reduced the
effect somewhat, since over half the subjects could not answer task
4 using the QA interface in the time allotted. With the DQ interface,
however, all but one subject was able to discern the trend in the time
allotted.
The scores for task 5 showed dramatic differences, with the
DQ interface averaging 58.8 seconds with a standard deviation of
only 16.3 seconds, while the QA interface averaged 189.9 seconds,
with a standard deviation of 67.2 seconds. In fact, all but one subject
answered the question in less than a minute using the DQ interface.
The exception to the trend (or multiple search) question required
combining the results of two or more searches or finding the outlying
point in a set. In this case, the exception was a home that was cheap
for what it offered. These types of questions are often what people
are searching for in a database. They often wish to find the most
stressed part of an airplane, the cheapest car which provides all the
options desired, or the deaths that seem to occur not due to cancer or
other common environmental factors. Since dynamic queries excel
in searching for these outliers, other applications involving this type
of search could clearly benefit from its use.
In all fairness, it is difficult to honestly compare the QA, DQ,
and paper interfaces since the ways user’s use each are so different.
QA requires typing with little guidance, while the DQ interface must
be ‘custom-made’ for the fields the user will search on. Therefore, it
is difficult to specifically identify the advantages or disadvantages;
however, from a usability standpoint, it does seem that the DQ
interface does perform better, overall, than QA for some types of
questions.
This study and others (Ahlberg, Williamson, & Shneiderman,
1992) have shown dynamic queries to have several benefits over
current systems:
● Queries can be made much faster by sliding the sliders and seeing
rapid feedback directly on the display.
● Novices can learn to use the system quickly with both queryfortnulation and result displayed in task domain.
● Intermittent users do not have to remember any syntax. Repeat
users quickly remember how to form a query.
● No error messages are needed since sliders restrict ranges. Also
encourages user to explore.
● Users can fine-tune their search easily. Simply restricting one field
allows tuning until desired number of hits.
● Actions are incremental and reversible.
● Trends and content of the database are easily inferred.
● Well-suited for geographical information systems and public
access using a touchscreen.
cDisplay in task-domain is more useful, less intimidating, and speeds
training time.
Although dynamic queries show promise, they are far from
perfect. Many drawbacks limit the range of its applicability or pose
other problems:
cData must be ordered in some way, in particular textual fields don ‘t
benefit from the dynamic nature of sliders.
● Limited screen real-estate make it difficult to keep both tools and
display on-screen.
● Difficult to use when a large number of fields are searchable due to
limited screen space and computational issues.
● Data structures to permit more rapid querying (especially for large
databases) are clearly necessary.
● Work best with data which can be displayed in some graphical
fashion.
. Difficult for dynamic queries to offer more complex boolean
queries such as unions and negations.
● Recently we have devloped a range slider with draggable ends,
partially solving some of these limitations.
● Smarter ways to utilize the limited screen space without sacrificing
simplicity are clearly needed.
● Perhaps the most major drawback, as of now, they require custom
programming to create an interface. Even adding additional criteria
(such as crime rate or some such) for querying requires significant
adjustment. We are currently designing a DQ toolkit to minimize
this difficulty.
This initial study needs to be replicated with other subjects,
database domams, queries, and with more experienced users to
assess the full range of strengths and weaknesses of dynamic queries.
Despite the drawbacks, dynamic queries clearly have application in
a range of areas. For geographic information systems they show
clear promise. For textual purposes, however, the problems outweigh
the benefits. Since the results of this study suggest users find
dynamic queries more enjoyable to work with and can complete
typical tasks in equal or less time than a traditional natural-language
query system, it seems clear these principles have a place in the
design of future information retrieval systems.

Illustrated and edited transcript of the YouTube video playlist: HAR 2009: Lightning talks Friday. Videos of the talk at the end.



Don Hopkins with SimCity running on OLPC XO–1 at HAR 2009
I’m Don Hopkins, and this is the Micropolis Online project.

I’ll give you a quick history, and then try to get through the slides to the demo.

History
Porting SimCity to Unix
I started working on SimCity about 1992.

When I saw it at college before that, I just fell in love with it, and really wanted to figure out how it worked, and do stuff with the user interface and everything.



HyperLook SimCity for the NeWS (left) and X11 (right) window systems, on a Sun workstation.
So when I had the chance to port SimCity to the Sun Workstation, I jumped at that, and made a version of it using the NeWS window system, James Gosling’s PostScript based window system.

And then I developed an X11 version of SimCity, which was multi player. We sold that as a Unix product. Then the contract expired on that.

Demo of Pie Menus in SimCity for X11.
The NeWS and X11 version both supported advanced user interface features like multiple animated maps and editors, as well as pie menus. The X11 version supported multiple player collaboration, shared text chat and drawing, and voting dialogs. And Unix workstations could run the simulation orders of magnitude faster than home computers, which transformed SimCity into a fast action twitch game!


Will Wright Holding a Sim
Working with Will Wright at Maxis
Later on I went on to Maxis to work on The Sims with Will Wright.

I dredged up this SimCity code, and we talked Electronic Arts into making it open source under the GPLv3 a few years ago.

The argument — not the argument: actually they were very pleasant about it — the thing that convinced them that it was a good idea was the One Laptop Per Child project.

Freeing SimCity under GPLv3 for the OLPC
The OLPC project is focused on “Constructionist Education”, which is about children learning — anyone learning, by building things.

And SimCity is pretty much the quintessential constructionist education game.

But it needed to be opened up, so that it can be even better.

So we convinced Electronic Arts to open it up by relicensing the original Unix SimCity code under the GPLv3 free software license, so we could adapt it for the OLPC, and open it up even more! If you’re curious how we pulled that off, Chaim Gingold tells all in his dramatic behind-the-scenes story of Open Sourcing SimCity, in his PhD dissertation on Play Design.

The OLPC is About Constructionist Education

Seymour Papert and his Logo Turtle
This OLPC project is based on Seymour Papert’s ideas about teaching children to program, even when they’re very young, and Alan Kay’s ideas about the Dynabook and object oriented programming, and how kids learn.


A cartoon from Alan Kay’s original research paper on the DynaBook
One of the important things about constructionism is kids helping each other, communicating, and learning from each other.

I adapted the old X11/Unix version of SimCity to the OLPC XO-I Children’s Laptop. The original X11 version supported multi player mode, but I disabled that feature to simplify the game, because it didn’t scale well, was complex to configure, and not well designed. OLPC games for kids need to be very easy to use.

A demonstration of OLPC SimCity running on the One Laptop Per Child XO-1 laptop.
What we really needed to do was to make a new version that had a much better user interface designed to take advantage of the OLPC collaboration features and social networking platforms like Facebook. It needs to have meaningful, scalable, easy to use multi player interaction.


Fortunately, the OLPC project chose to use Python as the official scripting language. Python is a powerful, easy to learn language, that is widely used in education. It’s also very useful as a web programming language, for implementing a multi player game server.

But let me go on:

Micropolis Project Goals
Develop a fun web based educational game, based on the original SimCity source code.
Focused on constructionist education.
Built out of free open source software.
Runs on the server, plays in the browser.
Supports collaborative, democratic, multi-user play.
The goals: We want to make a fun game that’s based on the original source code.

“Constructionist Education” is a the overall theme, but it’s not obvious how that actually manifests itself in a game, and it takes a lot of experimentation, trial and error to figure out.

We’re using free open source software, distributing it over the web, and running it on centralized servers. So it’s easy to make updates to the game as the design evolves.

We want to put in features to support collaboration, voting, teach democracy, and also teach language skills and interpersonal communication skills.

Accomplishments So Far

SimCity on the OLPC XO-1
Ported and shipped the TC L/Tk/X11 version of Micropolis on the One Laptop Per Child XO-I.
Developed a cross platform, desktop version of Micropolis, based on GTK/Python.
Developed an open source, internationalized, web based version of Micropolis.
Client based on OpenLaszlo/Flash.
Server based on TurboGears/Python/C++.
Renovated, re-factored and documented the code.
Established a solid groundwork and open framework for developing an educational, collaborative, multi-player game.
So far what’s been done: First, we took the old TCL/Tk/X11 version, cleaned it up, got it through EA’s Quality Assurance, and put it on the One Laptop Per Child.

Then we stripped down the code, translated it into C++, then cleaned it up, refactored it, and took out all the user interface. Then we started building a new user interface on top of that.

I had some really great help from some talented people. John Gilmore supported me for many years during the development of SimCity, and shepherded it through the complex legal process of relicensing it under GPLv3.

Albert Hofkamp is a software developer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. He helped me clean up this code, and put Doxygen documentation into it. Now the code is much sturdier and easier to do something with.

Tom Tjon A Loi is a an artist who’s also helping on the project. I’ll show you some ideas that we’ve put together about what direction it’s going to go in the future.

We’re also benefiting from Kennisnet and IBM Netherlands, who are helping us make an educational version of this game.

The OLPC has been something for people to focus on, and get a bunch of people on board to make this happen. But we want Micropolis to run on as many different platforms as possible.

What’s really wonderful is that I have had some really great conversations about this and encouragement from Alan Kay, who has been trying to do this stuff for years with kids.

Alan Kay’s criticism of SimCity is that you can’t see inside of it and understand what it’s doing, and you have to accept it as a black box. So now I’m trying to solve that problem.

Open Source Software

Micropolis is built with a carefully chosen, well proven, widely supported set of open source, cross platform tools and libraries.
Micropolis itself and its TileEngine module are open source (GPL3). The client runs on the proprietary Adobe Flash player. With a little more work, The client will also run in standard browsers, thanks to OpenLaszlo.
Linux. Apache. MySQL. Python. Cairo. Pango. GTK. GCC. SWIG. PyCairo. PyGTK. TurboGears. Genshi. SQLAlchemy. CherryPy. PyAMF. AMFast. Pie menus. OpenLaszlo. Red5. Java. Tomcat. MediaWiki. PHP. Subversion. Doxygen.
We’re using a whole bunch of Free and open source software, building on top of it, and then making new software that’s open source.

One of the things that the OLPC project wants game developers to do is to make games out of modular components that can be plugged together to make other games.

So I’ve been separating out the tile engine of SimCity, and the sprites, and the sound, and trying to make those work for other things.

Web Server and Client
Server: Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python, TurboGears, SWIG, C++
Portable, cross platform C++ and Python code.
Linux and Unix
Mac OS/X
Windows (not currently maintained but viable)
Deploys on standard Fedora Linux server, i.e. Amazon Elastic Computing Server, etc.
Client: OpenLaszlo, XML, JavaScript, AMF
Web based client runs in Adobe Flash player, widely supported on most web browsers and operating systems.
The architecture of the web version is that there’s a C++ core MicropolisEngine, which is plugged into the Python programming language as an extension module. Then Python is used to script the higher level parts of the game, graphics and web server. The user interface is implemented in the client, which is written in OpenLaszlo and runs on Flash in the web browser.

I’m using SWIG, a tool for making wrappers for libraries, and plugging them into extension language. And it lets you get your library to a whole bunch of different extension languages. So right now it’s Python, but it could be Lua or Java or whatever.

The SWIG wrapper layer around the C++ game engine is glue that binds the game’s C++ classes into Python. So C++ can call Python, and Python can call C++, and they can access and modify each other’s data structures. One nice thing about SWIG is that you can subclass your C++ classes in Python, and then just script everything in a nice language.

It’s all open source stuff.

The web server does HTTP and it does Adobe AMF, which is kind of like binary JSON for Flash.

Now I’m doing the client in another open source scripting language called OpenLaszlo. It’s like JavaScript and XML that gets compiled into Flash. But it will also compile into generic DHTML.

Micropolis (SimCity) Web Demo

Micropolis (SimCity) Web Demo
Right now I’m concentrating on just getting the Flash interface working, and once the paint’s dry on that, I can then do the parts that were Flash specific using the Canvas and DHTML and nice open standards like that.

The intention is to get it independent of Flash, but Flash is the fastest way to get it working first.

The other thing I have is a Python scripted GTK based user interface, for the desktop.


Micropolis on Python/GTK/Cairo/Pango
Internationalization
All text comes from Unicode XML localization files, so the text can be translated to support different languages and countries.
Currently supports English and Dutch, but other languages are easy to add, given translation resources.
Web based tools for conveniently reviewing and editing translations.
This is a very important feature, since we’re initially delivering to the Dutch educational system, and we intend to support many other languages in the future.
Another important thing is internationalizing it and taking all the strings out. I would love to have volunteers to help translate it to other languages. I made a little web based tool to do that. We’re doing this for the Dutch educational system, with Kennisnet’s support.

Multi Player Collaboration
Designed, developed and shipped a multi-player X11 version of SimCity in 1993 for DUX Software, demonstrated in Amsterdam at INTERCHI ‘93.
Micropolis has been systematically redesigned with multi-player collaboration and constructionist education in mind.
Currently laying the groundwork for multi player and online community support, while getting the single player game up and running first.
User accounts. Saved cities. Shared cities. Chat. Robots and Avatars. Basic MediaWiki integration. Client/server session, messaging and simulation engine plumbing.



Multi Player TCL/Tk SimCity for the X11 Window System on a Sun Workstation, SGI Workstation, and NCD X Terminal
Previously I made a multi player version of this for X11. But X11 doesn’t scale very well, and it was kind of an experiment.

But it did test out some ideas of making it a collaborative, cooperative game, instead of a competitive game.

I didn’t want to mess up the game, but I wanted to layer another social game on top of it.

We’re all sharing the same money, we’re trying to achieve the same goals, so if somebody does something that pisses you off, you’re going to be mad at them, and won’t play with them. That will play out at a higher level than the game.

It’s got voting for expensive things, like making a nuclear power plant, or changing the taxes. And the non-expensive things are just a free-for-all.

I want to re-visit the multi player game, but first get a really solid base to build it on top of. Doing a web based game is the best way to do that.

Multi Player SimCityNet for X11 on Linux
Constructionist Education
The original SimCity game was an exemplary constructionist educational game, which has been successfully used in many classrooms, but it was a closed commercial product, not specifically designed to support education.
Since Micropolis is open source SimCity, we can open up, renovate, visualize, document and extend it in wonderful ways, to specifically support constructionist education, social networking and collaborative democratic play.

MediaWiki Logo
I’m adding stuff, like integrating it with MediaWiki.

One of the important things about Constructionist Education is getting people to help each other out, and chat.

I want to teach language skills with this. Not just how to be a good mayor. That’s not the goal. It’s how to write about what you want to do, and convince other people to vote for it.

I think it’s going to be nice to embed this in things like Facebook and MediaWiki, because what you’re doing is writing stories and newspapers, and blogging.


The Sims Box
The Sims 1 (and later versions) had something called The Sims Exchange, where when you save your game file, it also writes out a bunch of web files, that describe your house, your family, the story you’ve told about them with pictures. And then it uploads that to the web.

So really, the game is a web publishing tool. I want to apply those ideas to SimCity, and that would be in the form of a newspaper. So you could act as a journalist when something happened.

These events in the game are generating opportunities for you to click on it, open it up, and write about what your interpretation of it is. And then automatically push it into a wiki page or a blog.


Don Hopkins
So the result of playing a game will be this rich save file that has points of interest with stories attached to them. You could look at it geographically as a map, to see all the points of interest. You could look at it as a calendar, like a blog. And then all these things that happened with the story can link to a save file, so you can then jump back into the game at that point.

The eventual goal is to make it sort of like TiVo for SimCity. You have all these save file snapshots, and then you can fast forward and reverse by replaying the edits that you did.

And you will have branching. You can imagine that when you play game, at any point, if you decide “let’s raise taxes”, you could make a checkpoint there. And then you could revisit that decision, and then branch reality out to another thing, if you didn’t raise taxes.

I want players to be able to make a tree of possibilities, and then share all these save files, and then comment on them, and write about them.

That’s where the educational stuff comes in. The teacher should be able to write scenarios that plug into the game, that generate events, and give people things to discuss.


Alan Kay
Alan Kay said some really wonderful things about the project to bring open source SimCity to the OLPC:

“One of the most wonderful possibilities about this venture is that it will bring together very fluent designers from many worlds of computing (more worlds than usually combine to make a game) in the service of the children. We should really try to pull this off!” -Alan Kay

I’m looking for volunteers. I never thought I’d be working directly or indirectly with Alan Kay, so it just blew my mind that he was interested in it. And he’s very supportive.

Here’s the long term goal: There’s a game, and there’s a robot or a monster. You double click on a monster, and it should open up a window that has a visual program that controls how it behaves.

This has already been done in the 80’s on the Apple ][, and it was a game called Robot Odyssey, by Warren Robinett, who made Atari Adventure. And it was so before its time. It turns out that it is one of Alan Kay’s favorite games, and that he’s waiting for the other shoe to drop.





Robot Odyssey
Robot Odyssey taught visual programming and logic to kids. You go inside a robot, and it’s a room, with plugs and sensors, and you have logic parts that you can bring out, and make a circuit inside that robot.

What I’m trying to do — oh I’d better get to the demo — is do this within SimCity. And with a visual programming language that’s just a layer on top of Python. We already have Python. I like Python. It’s well designed. I’m not going to try to invent something different, I just want to give you a visual way to get to everything Python can do, which is anything.

Educational Applications
Encourage creative writing by blogging, twittering, chatting, debating, writing and publishing newspaper articles about events and issues in the city.
Teach democratic processes. Writing proposals. Campaigning for support. Discussing and debating issues. Voting on bills.

Logo Turtle
Publish wiki pages with interactive annotated maps, timelines of events and creative writing about the cities.
Open up the simulator to enable plug-in programmable zones, tools, robots, avatars, events, policies, courseware, etc.
Teach older kids to program Python and C++. Implement a visual behavior programming language (like Robot Odyssey and SimAntics). Teach younger kids to think logically and program robots (like Logo turtles and Lego Robotics).
How does Constructionist Education manifest itself in something like SimCity?
Creative writing, blogging, twittering and chatting: and all this social stuff that people do.

Democracy. Writing proposals. Trying to get somebody to support your proposal. Publishing things into wikis.


Schoolhouse Rock
The teachers should be able to write courseware, scenarios, teaching events and educational content that plugs into the game, without any programming.

Opening it up to enable plugin programming. The first step is to look at the code to see how it works. And then tweak it and change it, and then make your whole new thing.

The older kids and adults can use existing examples to learn Python and C++ programming.

And younger kids plus everyone else will have an easier, higher level visual programming language in which to discover and customize the system.

That is version three. I’m only at version one right now.

Next Steps
Shared city library. Ratings. Tagging. Journals. Discussions. Linking. History browsing. Sharing. Voting. Profiles. Friends.
Text, voice and video chat. In-game chat with avatars on the map. Integrated video player for help, tutorials and lessons. Integrated html frame for synchronized web browsing.
MediaWiki integration, to support creative writing by students and courseware development by teachers.
PayPal integrations. Donations, subscriptions and micro-payments, for virtual money, cheats, high speed simulation, extra storage, fund raising, etc.
I have the web server and browser client running. I want to put in sharing cities, tagging, journals, discussions — you know, the whole social net thing. It occurs to me that maybe I should just let Facebook handle a lot of that stuff. I’ll just make a Facebook application.

Slow the game down a lot, so your Facebook wall will let your friends vote on things. I’m getting ahead of myself.

MediaWiki integration. Take well known things that solve a problem well, and piggy back on top of them, instead of trying to invent your own things.

PayPay, so we can pay for all the CPU time it takes.

Social Networking
Tom Tjon A Loi made these mock-ups of what SimCity might look like inside a social network like Facebook.

Identity

The important thing is that you have to have an identity. It knows about you. You’re part of a community of real people.

Voting

You’ve got friends, and this could be a Facebook app. If you add the app, you can do all this stuff and play it yourself. But even if you don’t add the app, you can still see and interact with what other people are doing.

Citizen

It’s all about showing other people what you’re doing, explaining it to them, discussing the issues, and getting their feedback.

Journal

You can have these links into the save files, and people saying things. I want to make it so one game might last a week, and take many little steps.

Community

What I have already made to prove the concept of plugins, is plugin zones. The first plugin zone I made was a plugin church, because that’s controversial and will upset people.

The idea is that I want to be able to script churches and other zones in Python. And create new zones and content for them without even programming. The other plugin is a plugin character, or agent. Like the monster or helicopter, with programmable behavior.

Chat

In a multiplayer game, there could be several people in the same game, and you’re all on the same map in one place, and you can chat embedded in the game, with collaborative editing.

If you put something down, it would open up an interface that says: “Hey, Don wants to make this. Do you vote for it? Yes or no.” And then have a chat associated with that, where you can discuss the issue.

Squatters

And then imagine other people could come into you game, and they find: “Hey this zone is not developed. We’re going to put a coffeeshop here!”

I want it eventually to be open enough that other people can come in and affect your game. And of course you always have a save file.

Micropolis Demo
(This is a transcript of the videos you can watch below…)

There’s a tool for doing translations.


The source code, designs and documentation are all in Google Code.


Ah, that’s the robot! I wanted to show some code. This is how PacMan works. He follows the road.

So I wrote a plugin robot that you can put into the city.


I’d better get to the actual code that’s running.


These are the different scenarios, we could load, or generate something randomly. Here, we’ll do one of my favorite cities here. I made this city.


This is a neat kind of a lazy tile view. There are 120 by 100 tiles on the server, and we’re telling the server where we’re looking at. And it’s sending just the tiles that we need to see.


Things that happen in the city get logged, and there’s a chat.

This will help you figure out what you need to do to improve you city.

This is a history.


Here’s the nice one here: we can raise taxes a lot. It was so funny because the taxes in the Netherlands are so much more than 20%.


We can look at the population density map overlay.


Ok, now here’s a meltdown. And when you get a meltdown, the notice window says “Hey there’s a meltdown!”, and has a live view showing it, that you can click on to go there.


Now this little window up here, when something interesting happens in the game, will show you a live view, and tell you something. But we can also have a link to Wikipedia or whatever.

I want to put in more educational stuff. Like the church says “Hey, did you know that Scientologists believe this?” and “Click here for more!”. We can think of the churches as in-game advertising.

And then if you have too many churches, you use the bulldozer to get rid of them.

There’s a speed control. I can make it go super-duper fast. And everybody just left. This is more like a twitch game.

Let me do the cheat. Ok, what is it? I just added this, so I’m not quite sure. You go “!faith 1000”. That makes them want a lot more churches. Woah! Ok, so I’m getting many churches. There goes the tax base.

I’ve programmed a plug-in church with a plug-in agent: the Church of Pacmania, and the PacBot. The church spawn PacBots on the road next to it, which eat the traffic on the roads (lowering the pollution and raising their score, of course). So naturally the Church of Pacmania generate a lot of traffic, to attract and feed the PacBots. I’m going to have a “Tax the Churches” option, too. If I lower the taxes, then more people will come in, and the churches will recruit them, and they’ll all drive to church. So then there will be a lot more traffic for the PacBots to eat.

Oh, I ran out of money. Let me do the robots real quick. So this is PacBot. You can put him down. Oh, I’m out of money! The fastest way is to just refresh the screen, and start fresh.

We’ll go straight in, we’ll get rid of this. Oh, pie menus, right! If you click… (Dutch “Taartmenu” cursor pops up!) I’ve got to have a talk with my translator.


You click, and you get a pie menu, which has items around the cursor in different directions. So if you click and go right, you get a road. And then you can do a little road. And if you click and go up and right, you get a bulldozer.


And then there are submenus for zoning parks, and stuff like that. This gives you a nice quick gesture interface.


The one I wanted was PacBot. So if you click him, that’s running Python code that is looking at the map, and is looks for the traffic, and it goes up, up, up, up, up. See?


Wait, you haven’t — hang on, wait: you can have lots of them. And then they compete. You get this wonderful emergent behavior of PacBot looking for traffic, and then the other PacBot eats it. You really need to zoom this up a little bit.


The great thing about this: this is another game layered on top. You can make your PacBot maze, and then you can torture them. They’ll go crazy, it’s like a lion in his cage here. Ah, caught one! Ah! He’s blue. Let’s get him here. He’s not going to be happy about this. Where’d he go? Oh oh, there’s a menu to get rid of him, so I think I deleted him. Here, we’ll put one there. He’s just going nuts there.


Wait, where were we? Real quick. Where’s my iPhone? Did I leave the phone down here? You can’t see it so you’ll have to believe me.

The first multi-player interface I’m making is an iPhone app, so it loads the city, and it lets you zoom and run over it. And I’m just about to hook it up to the server, so you can come into the game as a helicopter, and just tilt to run around, and then just chat.

Eventually I want to do the whole game on the iPhone, Andriod and whatever else. The first step is to just get presence and chatting in there.

One interesting thing: Micropolis is GPLv3. So you can’t put it on the iPhone, because of the anti-TiVoization clause, which prohibits using hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware.

But it’s possible to have the simulation running on the server and a client displaying and interacting on the iPhone. I think it’s more interesting to have the simulation running on the server, in order to enable social interactions; and anyway there’s already an authentic single player SimCity that runs on the iPhone.


Any questions?

Q: What’s the cheat code to get money?

Mike: War!

Don: That’s what churches are for.

I encourage you to script your own church and plug it in. I’m totally going to have the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and he’s going to actually convert all the other churches to Flying Spaghetti Monster churches, so it will be a moot point, and there will be no war.

Announcer: Please thank Mr. Hopkins for his nice solution to the traffic problem.

PQDT Open: Play Design by Chaim Gingold, PdD
…
pqdtopen.proquest.com

Excerpt from Abstract
Will Wright created SimCity to amuse himself and learn about cities. To build it, he appropriated from multiple traditions in which computers are used as tools for modeling and thinking about the world as a complex system, most notably system dynamics and cellular automata. Wright’s make believe play was scaffolded by these software practices, which offered inspiration and guidance, as well as abstract computational primitives for world building.

Chapters 3–5 trace the historical contexts and origins of SimCity’s many design influences, from system dynamics (chapter 3) and cellular automata (chapter 4) — two very different ways of seeing, thinking about, and computationally representing the world — to Pinball Construction Set and Raid on Bungling Bay (chapter 5).

Taking up the evolution of software in this way allows us to see how it is formed, what it is made of, and how ideas are embedded within and perpetuated by it. Deconstruction also helps us to understand software as a medium of dynamic representation, a scaffold for thought, an aesthetic experience, and its appeal as a resource for play.

In Chapter 5, SimBusiness, I give a historical account of SimCity’s creation and the social circumstances that shaped its design, and sketch the history of Maxis, the company that marshaled and published SimCity. The trajectory of Maxis offers a parable about play and creativity. We see in Maxis’s formation and unraveling the inescapable tension between play and capitalism, and between intrinsic and extrinsic play — the private autotelic play that innovates and creates, and the public play of player-consumers that pays the bills.

Chapter 6, SimCity, completes the SimCity case study by considering it as play artifact and experience. Using extensive diagrams that translate and map its code, I perform a close reading of SimCity, explaining how it conjures the illusion of a miniature living city, and how this living world scaffolds play.

Excerpt from page 289–293
Open Sourcing SimCity
The next chapter looks closely at the code to SimCity, which is possible only because it has been open sourced. There are few instances in which a company has open sourced the code to a commercial game, which makes the story of how this happened remarkable for a number of reasons. Recounting this story not only explains the provenance of my research materials, but reveals how social forces, in this case a heterogeneous collection of agents and agendas, shape software.

The process by which SimCity was open sourced underlines its status as an evocative object. SimCity’s polymorphism, its seemingly simultaneous playful, serious, educational, commercial, abstract, and naturalistic qualities are precisely what enabled it to thrive in so many different contexts. This bundle of appealing contradictions is what enabled different agents to see in SimCity what they wanted, a perceptual process which recalls Brian Sutton-Smith’s Ambiguity of Play, and its thesis that play is susceptible to radically diverse essentializing rhetorics (Sutton-Smith 1997).

In 1991 the computer manufacturer Sun Microsystems, as part of an initiative to address the market for GIS computing (geographic information system), became interested in bringing SimCity into their platform. Sun’s business was rooted in selling Unix workstations, and to that end, would often support the development of applications for specific market verticals. In the summer of 1991, Sun circulated a message to gauge interest in SimCity:

The GIS and Desktop Applications Segments have a window of opportunity to get the #1 selling game “SimCity” ported to Sun. The opportunity also allows us to open up the software so that it can become a front end to GIS applications by including ToolTalk and/or import/export file capability to the standard GIS formats. This and networking will differentiate it from the PC version. The Sun SimCity version will allow Sun to offer a true “desktop” GIS solution as well as a leading entertainment package!

The game is currently being used by many government offices to train their city planners. We have already received high support from ESRI [a developer of commercial GIS products] and URISA [a GIS education and advocacy non-profit] to move the game over and now are seeking Sun field encouragement that will concur with our direction.

Please respond with any comments or customer interest that you think would support the project. [66]

[66] This message, an email sent to an internal Sun mailing list, was made available to me by Don Hopkins.

The potential for a serious application, such as GIS, is overblown — it is hard to imagine SimCity enabling Sun to offer a “true ‘desktop’ GIS solution.” The email, however, speaks to the appeal of SimCity as a compelling representation of a city. Not only was it serious enough for GIS, but it was fun, qualities which enabled it to become absorbed into the current of Sun’s marketing agenda.

One person who responded enthusiastically to this proposition was Don Hopkins, a programmer at Sun who first played SimCity in 1989, while studying computer science at the University of Maryland, where it made a deep impression upon him. While a student, Hopkins had worked for the influential user interface researchers Ben Shneiderman and Marc Weiser, where he contributed to the development of pie menus (see Callahan et al. 1988), an unconventional graphical user interface mechanism that would eventually figure prominently in The Sims, on which Hopkins would be a key contributor. [67]

[67] Pie menus play a critical role in The Sim’s user interface design, dovetailing perfectly with the object and AI architecture. Objects advertise verbs to character AI, so it is natural for the verbs to be arranged in a radial menu about objects. I can’t imagine an alternate design that would have had the same widespread usability, and therefore appeal, without them. It is difficult to imagine The Sims without pie menus.

Hopkins began work on the SimCity to Unix conversion while working at Sun, but the project was eventually completed under the aegis of DUX Software. On July 19th 1991, DUX signed a ten year contract to convert and market SimCity on Unix, with Hopkins brought on as a contractor about six months later. [68] Using the Macintosh version of SimCity, Hopkins performed the conversion, rewrote the remaining sections of assembly language to platform neutral C, and changed the platform from Macintosh to X11. Throughout the 1990’s, Hopkins did the programming necessary to convert SimCity to a wide variety of Unix platforms, adding pie menus and multiplayer support (Perkins 1993; Hopkins 2013; Joffe 2015).

[68] Bruce Joffe, Wright’s neighbor and friend with a background in city planning, GIS, and computer simulation, was almost brought onto the DUX project, via Braun and Wright, in order to advise on its conversion to a more serious simulation (Joffe 2015; Joffe 2016).

But it was the humanitarian One Laptop Per Child project that would provide the impetus for open sourcing Hopkins’s conversion. In 2005 Nicholas Negroponte presented the idea for an inexpensive laptop for children in developing countries that came to be known as OLPC (One Laptop Per Child). The effort traded upon the significant influence and prestige of Negroponte and others. [69] Reflecting both a desire to minimize cost and a particular ideological bent, the OLPC operating software was a Unix (Linux) variant with a GUI called Sugar — all of it open source and free software. This, in turn, set the stage for acquisition and development of open source, free, educational, and child-appropriate software that could run on such a low cost computer. SimCity, ever the evocative and fluidly perceptible object, was a perfect candidate, aside from one snag: it was proprietary software owned by Electronic Arts, the company that had bought Maxis.

[69] This philanthropic agenda built upon decades of thinking about children, computers, and education, for example the work of Alan Kay and Seymour Papert, whose seminal work is specifically called out as part of the history of OLPC on its official web site (http://www.laptop.org/en/vision/project/index.shtml, accessed June 10, 2015). Trained as an architect, Negroponte founded the MIT Architecture Machine Group, later co-founding and directing the MIT Media Lab, both of which were hugely influential research sites.

In November 2006 John Gilmore, one of the founders of the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) and an early Sun Microsystems employee, asked Don Hopkins if he could ask Will Wright, whose prestige was at a zenith within Electronic Arts, about open sourcing or buying the original SimCity. Gilmore knew that Hopkins had completed the Unix port, was a close and long time associate of Wright’s, and that the original 1989 SimCity would have presently been making very little, if any, money for EA. Hopkins, believing the request to be futile, nonetheless passed it along to Wright, who was enthusiastic about the idea, and introduced it to some other EA executives (Rod Humble and Scott Evans). Within EA, Chuck Norman was deputized for shepherding the process along (Hopkins 2013). [70]

[70] My account is largely based upon an interview I conducted with Hopkins as well as emails he has made available to me (Hopkins 2013).

Surprisingly, Electronic Arts agreed to the arrangement. Their legal counsel, in consultation with Eben Moglen (Columbia Law Professor, general counsel to the FSF, and OLPC advisor), worked through the legal logistics. This effort was aided by Hopkins’s discovery and copying of the original Maxis/DUX licensing agreement, on a lark, while working on The Sims. Hopkins did the coding work of the conversion. [71] EA executives approved of the endeavor, no doubt aided by Will Wright’s legendary persuasiveness and considerable prestige, not to mention the prestige of the OLPC project itself.

[71] The Unix and then open sourced versions have undergone multiple iterations. The OLPC version is based on the original open sourced version, which is written in C for X11 with TCL/Tk. Hopkins introduced some optimizations and, I believe, some bugs in this version (the tile animation system). Hopkins would go on to rewrite Micropolis in C++, cleaning up and organizing the code. Java and JavaScript translations now exist, too.

There were a couple of notable stipulations. First, that EA’s quality assurance (QA) test and approve any release titled “SimCity.” For this reason, Hopkins renamed the project “Micropolis,” an earlier working title for SimCity. Second, as a post-9/11 consideration, EA requested that the airplane crash disaster be removed from the game. Regard for publicity, both negative and positive, must have driven these stipulations as well as the decision to move forward with the project.

SimCity began life as Wright’s private toy, and went on to be continually recast as commercial software (Maxis), serious simulation (Sun), and educational plaything (OLPC). It’s polymorphic quality allowed it to be perceived and used by diverse agents, who turned it towards satisfying their own particular agendas and contexts. This interpretive versatility, which can productively be understood through Sutton-Smith’s notion of play’s ambiguity, is crucial to SimCity’s evocativeness, and ultimately led to its availability as free open source software.

I've always felt that Sim City is one of
0:01
those games that seems like in
0:02
retrospect it just should not have been
0:04
possible at the time it was released
0:06
it's a work of true genius but it also
0:08
begs the question how exactly did Will
0:11
Wright manage to get an entire city
0:13
simulated on a PC with a minimum of a
0:16
386 processor in Just 2 MB of ram now
0:20
technically we've known the anwers to
0:21
these questions for a while now the
0:23
source code to Sim City is open source
0:25
and you can still get it on GitHub right
0:27
now but of course for most Gamers myself
0:30
included digging into the source code is
0:31
not a very useful option and a simpler
0:34
answer can be elusive or at least it was
0:37
elusive because a new book has dropped
0:39
that explains the inner workings of Sim
0:41
City in a way that is detailed yet
0:44
understandable I'm talking about
0:46
building Sim City how to put a world in
0:48
a machine by Heim gingold a designer on
0:51
Spore in the main designer on the Spore
0:54
creature Creator which as you might
0:57
remember was actually sold as standalone
0:59
softare
1:00
this is not the book because I was in a
1:02
PDF copy but I did read through the PDF
1:05
copy and I'm going to share some my
1:06
thoughts about it I do think it is a
1:08
wonderful book but also one that's a
1:10
little bit different from what you might
1:12
expect based on the title so let's get
1:14
into it now from the title of the book
1:16
you might expect that it's entirely
1:18
about Sim City and at 464 pages long
1:22
that seems like a lot of Sim City
1:24
certainly that would be one of the
1:25
largest books dedicated to a single game
1:28
I have ever seen on store shelves
1:30
however this is not actually what the
1:32
book is quite about while the book is
1:34
focused on Sim City the game doesn't get
1:37
a whole lot of coverage within the book
1:39
until the third part which starts around
1:41
page
1:42
185 which is a lot of pages before the
1:46
book about Sim City talks about Sim City
1:49
now what is in those pages well the book
1:51
goes to Great length to set up
1:53
everything you could possibly want to
1:55
know about the idea of simulating a city
1:58
before Sim City came about in fact the
2:01
entire first chapter of the book is
2:03
probably not very relevant if you are a
2:04
fan of Sim City or just games in general
2:07
because it's really talking about
2:09
children imagining how a City Works in
2:11
their own mind which is important for
2:13
the context of the book because it's
2:14
trying to talk about how we think about
2:16
simulating cities in general but if
2:18
you're here looking for game history
2:20
then that's probably not really going to
2:22
be of much interest to you and I didn't
2:24
end up eventually skimming over most of
2:26
this section because it just wasn't
2:27
really relevant to what I was looking
2:29
for the second section of the book is
2:31
more relevant to Sim City fans because
2:32
it starts to talk about the things that
2:34
inspired will right directly and does a
2:36
bit of a deep dive about the different
2:38
ideas and philosophies that Will Wright
2:41
was exposed to that sort of molded the
2:43
way he was thinking about simulating a
2:45
city in a computer with that said though
2:47
this is still not really game history so
2:49
again if you're looking for a book about
2:51
Sim City or video game history in
2:53
general those first two sections
2:55
actually are not especially useful for
2:58
you now you might be thinking what what
3:00
why why why would the first two sections
3:02
of this book not talk about Sim City
3:05
extremely directly and the answer to
3:07
that is that this is really more of a
3:09
textbook or at least an academic book
3:11
its goal is not to expose Sim City
3:15
itself in isolation although it
3:17
certainly does provide a lot of
3:19
interesting details but it's really
3:21
meant to provide an entire broader
3:23
context and when I say textbook well you
3:26
know it's not really formatted like the
3:28
textbooks you might be used to from I
3:30
don't know uh high school biology class
3:33
but this is very much the kind of book
3:35
that you would probably get assigned if
3:37
you are in a humanities class or you're
3:40
taking a game design class maybe
3:42
something specifically about simulating
3:45
things in video games it also might be
3:46
the kind of book that you would look at
3:48
if you're doing some urban planning and
3:49
one something a little bit off topic but
3:51
still relevant to add some spice to the
3:53
class I can very much see this being
3:55
inserted in there and indeed this is
3:57
published by MIT press and that tells
4:00
you a lot I think right away about the
4:01
intended audience of this book this is
4:03
not a mainstream book it's not one of
4:05
those coffee table books that's talking
4:08
about the Legend of Zelda for the 50th
4:10
time or it has a nice you know beautiful
4:12
cover with lots of excellent art inside
4:15
of it although there are some pretty
4:16
good pictures in it and I wish I would
4:17
have had a chance to look at the
4:19
physical book rather than just a PDF
4:21
copy to see exactly how high quality it
4:24
is when it comes off the press because
4:26
if it is a high quality book which again
4:28
I don't know cuz I didn't see the actual
4:30
physical book uh some of the stuff
4:31
that's in there could be pretty
4:32
impressive now everything I've said so
4:34
far might make you feel a little bit
4:35
down on the book you might be thinking
4:36
why would I want to read this book if
4:38
I'm a fan of Sim City or just a fan of
4:40
video game histories in general it does
4:42
really have much information for me and
4:44
the truth is it actually does have quite
4:46
a bit of information because that third
4:48
section is packed full of stuff now
4:51
really towards the end of the book is
4:52
where the explanation of Sim City itself
4:55
as a video game and how it works on a
4:57
technical level comes into play and here
5:00
ham has done a really good job of
5:02
providing excellent graphs and
5:04
infographics that really go into detail
5:06
about how exactly is the game working
5:09
and when I talk about how is the game
5:11
working I mean things like how does time
5:13
actually pass in Sim City what does it
5:15
mean for say a month the pass in Sim
5:18
City what happens on a sort of technical
5:21
level in The Game's code when that time
5:23
passes month to month in the game how is
5:26
this simulation interacting with each
5:28
other what are the different elements of
5:29
this simulation that are calculated on
5:31
each step of the simulation it's really
5:33
broken down in a lot of detail now if
5:36
you're a big fan of Sim City this is
5:37
probably going to be pretty interesting
5:38
to you I think that the only people that
5:40
wouldn't find a lot of information about
5:41
this are probably hardcore Sim City
5:43
modders or other fans who've already
5:45
dived into the source code if you've not
5:48
done that then you probably haven't had
5:50
the information that is in this book
5:51
ever presented to you with this kind of
5:53
clarity and it really will help you
5:55
understand a bit more about the game I
5:57
also think that if you are a game
5:58
designer and you're thinking about maybe
6:00
making a game about simulating a city
6:02
it's actually really interesting
6:04
information in my prior video about how
6:06
Sim City Works which I have a link to in
6:08
the description of this video if you
6:09
want to check it out I discussed a
6:11
little bit about how modern agent based
6:13
games although they tend to work better
6:15
than the older statistical based
6:18
simulations they don't always accomplish
6:20
all the goals that you would think they
6:22
would being an agent based system in
6:24
other words having all those agents
6:26
running around in your simulation
6:28
doesn't always provide a increase in the
6:30
level of detail for example if you play
6:32
City skylines to this very day a lot of
6:35
the way that is simulating say fire risk
6:38
is not based so much on simulations but
6:40
rather on just the radius around a fire
6:43
station and because that there's still a
6:44
lot of interesting insights in the
6:46
original Sim City also I think maybe if
6:49
you were trying to make a city
6:50
simulation and you wanted to make it
6:51
more efficient so it could run on Lower
6:53
End Hardware this probably is not a bad
6:55
thing to look at either another thing
6:57
this book does get into with quite a bit
6:58
of detail is the sort of personal
7:00
history of How Will Wright developed Sim
7:03
City and the steps he went to both in
7:05
terms of programming the game and also
7:07
getting together all the things that you
7:08
needed to get together to actually
7:10
publish game because BBN which was
7:12
initially going to be the publisher of
7:13
Sim City actually rejected it they
7:15
didn't think it was enough of a game and
7:17
it was not until will R got together
7:19
with Jeff Brun and they put together the
7:21
game and decided to put it out
7:22
themselves that the game was able to hit
7:25
store shells this of course led to the
7:27
formation of Maxis and Maxis this ended
7:30
up being an incredible Powerhouse I
7:32
think we actually forget how much of a
7:34
Powerhouse Max's was in the mid 9s this
7:37
is a studio that had an initial public
7:40
offering yeah if we were talking about
7:42
Maxis today I think we'd probably have
7:44
Financial YouTubers talking about
7:46
whether or not it was a new meme stock
7:47
or something along those lines it was
7:49
incredibly popular and initially uh the
7:52
stock went up quite a bit but that did
7:54
not last that actually brings me to the
7:56
other interesting part and actually the
7:58
most interesting part about the personal
7:59
history of how the game and its
8:02
successors was developed and that is the
8:04
kind of middle history of Maxis that is
8:08
after the publication of Sim City but
8:09
before electronic art ended up buying
8:12
the studio there was actually tons and
8:14
tons of Games published by Maxis during
8:16
that period not all of which were
8:18
developed by the studio in fact and as
8:20
the studio became more successful there
8:22
was a lot of business wrangling over how
8:25
the company was going to justify itself
8:28
and of course just ify that huge stock
8:31
price that it had at its IPO the answer
8:34
to that was they never Justified it and
8:36
Maxis ended up getting bot by Electronic
8:38
Arts and a lot of people will say that
8:40
Electronic Arts sort of led to the
8:42
downfall of Maxis but if you read what
8:45
is going on in this book I think it's
8:47
kind of hard to quite buy that narrative
8:50
and it becomes really clear that there's
8:51
a lot of strange stuff going on behind
8:53
the scenes even during the mid90s when
8:56
the studio was still publishing a lot of
8:57
very popular games and actually I don't
8:59
want to talk too much about these
9:01
various tidbits but one example I do
9:03
want to get just to kind of show you the
9:05
kind of information that is in this book
9:06
I learned while reading this that will
9:08
wrri actually didn't have a lot of clout
9:11
at Maxis at this time there were a lot
9:13
of people inside Maxis who were not
9:15
particularly happy with Will Wright as
9:18
things went into the 94 95 96 kind of
9:21
period you might think that developing
9:23
the game that put the studio on the map
9:24
to begin with would earn you a little
9:26
bit of credibility and I guess for a few
9:28
years it did but the problem was that
9:29
Maxis needed more hits and will wri he
9:33
just wasn't a hit making machine he
9:35
never has been he's an experimental sort
9:37
of guy he likes to do things that he
9:38
wants to do and he likes to do them on
9:40
his own time and that of course led to
9:42
some culture conflicts with the business
9:45
big wigs at Maxis who were constantly
9:47
pressuring the studio to put out more
9:49
games I was also surprised to see a fair
9:52
bit of detail about the Sims in this
9:54
book details that I didn't know about
9:56
now admittedly I'm not a person who's
9:58
very well versed in The Sims I have
10:00
played most of the titles but I never
10:01
really looked into the history behind
10:03
the game so I was very surprised to
10:05
discover just how actively will right
10:07
was pursuing the development of the Sims
10:10
during this mid90s period I assumed that
10:12
he had gotten the idea around this time
10:14
but that he didn't really start to
10:16
develop it until later in the '90s but
10:18
in fact he was pursuing it in this
10:20
mid90s period and that is what led to a
10:22
lot of the cultural conflicts in the
10:24
studio the last thing I want to say
10:26
about the quality of This Book Is that
10:28
the author hi am gingold he really knows
10:30
what he's talking about like I said he
10:31
worked on sport he worked with Will
10:33
right himself so he has a lot of at
10:36
least very close secondhand knowledge
10:38
about Sim City and how it was developed
10:41
and he was able to talk to will wght
10:42
himself to get his opinion and it is
10:44
reflected in some of the information in
10:46
this book there is a lot of stuff in
10:48
here that I've never heard of before
10:50
never seen published before new
10:52
information and even information that is
10:54
not necessarily new like how the game
10:56
works is explained in a lot of detail
10:58
and format in I've never seen before so
11:00
I actually came away with an much better
11:03
understanding of Sim City and I say this
11:05
again as someone who made a previous
11:07
video about how Sim City Works they did
11:09
a lot of research for that video and I
11:10
think that the information in there is
11:12
correct but there's still a lot of gaps
11:15
in there about some precise details of
11:17
what's going on in Sim City and this
11:19
book really fills in those gaps but of
11:21
course does that mean you should buy it
11:23
well an obstacle you're going to notice
11:25
is that this has a textbook prices it's
11:28
priced at 50 bucks for the paperback
11:30
yeah 50 bucks for a paperback not a
11:32
hardback and 35 bucks if you decide to
11:34
get a Kindle I feel pretty certain that
11:37
these are the kind of prices that are
11:38
justified by a book being assigned as
11:41
part of a college course so that's going
11:42
to be a little bit hard to swallow but
11:44
maybe it will go on sale in the future
11:47
some of these MIT press books do get
11:49
bumped down a little bit in price over
11:51
time on the other hand though sometimes
11:54
they don't and in fact they kind of go
11:55
up in price over time if they go out of
11:57
print so if you do read really really
12:00
really want this book I would suggest
12:02
you get it quickly if however you are on
12:05
the fence about it well maybe go for the
12:07
Kindle version it is at least a little
12:09
bit less expensive again this is a book
12:12
that is not trying to be a mainstream
12:14
audience this is not trying to be a
12:15
coffee table book this is really very
12:18
specifically targeted at first of all
12:20
people who want to know very detailed
12:22
information about Sim City and the
12:24
creation of it and two for people who
12:27
want to think about City seem ation in
12:30
general as a concept for people who want
12:32
to theorize about that of course that's
12:35
not going to be for everyone but I can
12:36
say for certain whether you buy this
12:38
book or not it's great that this book
12:39
exists because it has new information in
12:41
it and that means in the future when
12:43
people like myself are deciding to do
12:45
coverage of Sim City to talk about
12:47
various historical aspects of Sim City
12:49
we have a little bit more information
12:51
than we did before and for that reason I
12:53
think this is a very excellent book
12:56
thanks for watching and I'll see you
12:58
next time

Hi, Ben! I'm writing up some ideas in the MicropolisCore repo about the plans and inspiration for the web based version of SimCity/Micropolis, and visualization features to implement, so I want to include a nice section on your Dynamic Home Finder, which inspired me to make the Dynamic Zone Finder in SimCity, when you visited CMU while I was working for Brad Myers and developing the X11 multi player of SimCity in my spare time. 

I've found your classic papers and web page and several videos, but I'd like to know if you have a nice hires screen capture (for the working definition of hires back in the VGA days) or photograph of the screen you took with your high quality camera and film, that would be better than a frame capture of a YouTube video of a kind of dark VHS video tape of the demo that I was able to find on YouTube. 

I remember it was quite vibrant and punchy and responsive in reality, like a twinkly "1000 points of light", so the muddy YouTube screen shapshots just don't do it justice:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zthhyUVmq9M

Did you ever see Chaim Gingold's SimCity Reverse Diagrams, inspired by Stone Librande's and Brett Victor's work? He published it in his PhD thesis on Play Design then more recently his magnum opus book on Building SimCity! 

Chaim has kindly given me permission and encouragement to bring his SimCity Reverse Diagrams to life in the web based version of Micropolis! They will dovetail elegantly with the Dynamic Zone Finder! 

I highly recommend his book Making SimCity, which got rave reviews:

Stewart Brand's Review, which highlights the gorgeous reverse diagrams: "The exhaustively-researched illustrations are brilliant, and shockingly well printed in color--you can read them in depth." -Stewart Brand

I love this article! I worked with Ben Shneiderman at HCIL, and when he sent me a copy of this article to review, I was inspired by the "Dynamic Queries" of his "Dynamic Home Finder" demo, to implement something like that for SimCity (the Frob-O-Matic window). [Video and transcript below.]
Here are some of the main points of his article: [...]

Multi Player SimCityNet for X11 on Linux (Dynamic Home Finder / Frob-O-Matic demo at 3:35).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fVl4dGwUrA&t=3m35s

Transcript:

Here's an interesting thing inspired by Ben Shneiderman.

We can look at the ... This is the "Dynamic Zone Filter".

So we are going to set this to be dynamic.

Now it's going to show all the zones, but it's not going to show the ones that don't pass this filter.

So this filter is currently all the way open.

Now we're going to change population density.

This is a two-ended slider.

This is the segment of the population density, from zero to 81.

So everything else will disappear.

Say I'm looking for a home. I want low population density. But I want high rate of growth.

And now, these are the places that have low population density and high rate of growth.

And then you can just interactivally ... So each of these filters out some of the places.

So you can look at ... I don't want high traffic density. I don't want any pollution. I don't want any crime. I want land value to be high.

I'm getting pretty picky. So maybe I'll deal with more people. Lower rate of growth. I'm too picky about pollution. I'm too picky about land value. That's it.

So basically, Ben Shneiderman demonstrated this as the "Dynamic Home Finder", and I realized that SimCity has all these layers of information that it can draw on, as fictitious as they are, to do that kind of real time, interactive, smooth database query.

It's just a much higher bandwidth way to query a database than is conventionally used.

Anyway, that was the dynamic zone finder.

Also: Here's some email I wrote to Ben about this article, after re-reading the article again in 2009:

Date: 28/02/2009 18:51 Subject: Re-reading "Beyond Intelligent Machines"

A long time ago, you sent us (me, Brad Myers, Jack Callahan and Mark Weiser) a preview of your IEEE Software article "Beyond Intelligent Machines", which I ran across and have re-read.

It's still delightful, inspiring and relevant today.

Speech synthesis and recognition has come a long way, to the point where the "talking car" scenario is quite common (TomToms that speak and recognize street names and addresses).

But I think the development of user-customizable user interfaces has been dreadfully stalled since HyperCard died.

An "Interactive Learning Environment" is a great description of what I'm developing SimCity into.

Remember when you visited CMU and I showed you the version of SimCity with the dynamic query feature, an "homage" to your Dynamic Home Finder? You could dial a series of filters on spatial properties like population density, pollution, traffic, land value, police coverage, etc. That code is now open source, and I'm redeveloping it!

It's now very easy to write Python code to dynamically query and filter the map and data layers, and visualize with transparent colored tiles and pixel overlays, depending on arbitrary Python functions over the state of the map and its data layers.

And it's also possible to script agents in Python!

Here's a picture of SimCity with the traffic overlay enabled (showing yellow/orange/red haze over high traffic areas), with some PacMan agents, which are programmed to follow roads, go towards high traffic and eat the cars! Notice the clear road behind each PacMan!

Right, before the simulation ran on the browser and users had smart clients running on Flash, written with OpenLaszlo. (Which was like HyperLook a really cool UI building system that never made it mainstream). SvleteKit however includes many of hte cool featuyres of HyperLook and OpenLaszlo, but is extremely popular and has excellent developer satisfaction ratings. 

Here is some info about OpenLaszlo, which I used to develop the client Flash based side of the Python SimCity server based approach (running the simulator in a C++ python extension integrated with SWIG using TurboGears web application server. It used AMF protocol as a two-way json bridge to communicate with the server, and generated images and optimized tile map update instructions on the server tailored for each client's view. Multiple clients could view the same maps, and it could run many simulations with multuiple viewers in parallel. That was the octopus client/server approach as opposed to the current synchronized lockstep everyone runs a simulator, edits are timestamped by a central coordinator, and applied by clients at the same time, clients can easily roll back to a checkpoint and replay when they get out of date edits, to fix up the history. The simulator can run so fast it's trivial to fast forward through many years, and keep occastional keyframe checkpoints. The new version embraces modern best practices, gitops, networking, reactive user interface and constraint programming, ide integration, ai programming and enrichment tools, mcp control and cursor integration, etc. 



In the different sections on versions of SimCity's interface please write about the great feature of these platforms that benefited simcity, and the synergy of having a real world (so to speak) game like SimCity to stress test and dogfood an in-development or open-source user itnerface framework like HyperLook, HyperLook's real time audio mixer, TCL/Tk (pushing its nascent multi display support into actual multi player support), TCL/Tk audio mixer and support for NCD's X11-friendly audio protocol, OpenLaszlo and TurboGears and SWIG, then Python/PyGTK/Cairo/Pango/Sugar, and then SvelteKit!  Games can drive the development of the user inteface and tech platforms they're built on top of.

What is OpenLaszlo, and what's it good for?
Submitted by dhopkins on Fri, 2006-03-24 22:30. Laszlo Design
OpenLaszlo is an open source platform for developing user friendly web based applications, which work identically across all popular browsers and platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, IE, Firefox, Safari, etc). It's ideal for presenting and editing raw XML data generated by PHP and other web services.

OpenLaszlo supports a rich graphics model with scalable vectors, bitmaps, movies, animation, transparency, fonts, audio, streaming media, reusable components, user interface widgets, control panels, property sheets, keyboard navigation, browser "back button" navigation, as well as advanced WYSIWYG text and graphical editing tools. In other words, OpenLaszlo is the velvet glove for the iron fist of PHP. What can OpenLaszlo do?

Laszlo Mail
Laszlo Mail

Laszlo Mail is a great example of an advanced and robust mainstream OpenLaszlo application. EarthLink has deployed Laszlo Mail to millions of their customers, and Laszlo Systems also offers a free demo of Laszlo Mail for anyone to try. Be sure to check out the contact details, search interface, the WYSIWYG email editor, spelling checker, and how the user interface adapts as you resize the window.

Pandora
Pandora Music Discovery Service

The Pandora music discovery service is based on the music genome project, and it uses OpenLaszlo to implement a slick, easy to use interface for listening to your personalized internet radio stations via streaming MP3 audio. The service it available for free with advertisements, or by subscription without ads. Pandora's CTO, Tom Conrad, wrote on his blog about why they chose to use OpenLaszlo:

"Eight months ago when we sat down to figure out how were were going to deliver a compelling zero-install discovery and listening experience across Windows, Mac, and Linux in record time we considered everything you can imagine: plain old HTML, AJAX, Flex, OpenLaszlo to name just a few. In the end, Laszlo was the clear winner on all fronts. Mature, reliable, and the perfect tool for the job. This outcome was only remarkable in that the decision was made by some of the most capable AJAX developers on the planet. I'll have more to say about Laszlo in another post, but for now I just want to publicly say thanks to the great team at Lazslo. Pandora wouldn't be Pandora without you. (Tags: pandora, openlaszlo, ajax)"
Pie Menus
OpenLaszlo Pie Menu

Pie menus are a naturally efficient user-interface technique -- directional menu selection of pie slice-shaped targets. OpenLaszlo is perfect for developing reusable interface components such as pie menus, which are easily incorporated into Laszlo applications, and described and configured with XML. I've ported my open source JavaScript pie menu code to OpenLaszlo, and rewritten it to take advantage of Laszlo features like Flash graphics and animation, constraints, events, prototype customization, and XML data binding. I'm using the Laszlo pie menus in my own OpenLaszlo applications, including the Sims Content Catalog, the von Neumann 29 State Cellular Automata, and an experiment comparing Pie Menus -vs- Linear Menus. Here is the open source Laszlo Pie Menu Component Source Code, a live Laszlo Pie Menu Demo, and the Laszlo Pie Menu Demo Source Code, so you can see how easy it is to plug and play with Laszlo component, and define pie menus in XML.

Laszlo Explorer
OpenLaszlo Explorer

More live demos of open source example Laszlo applications are available online from Laszlo Systems, and their full source code and documentation is included with the free OpenLaszlo distribution. The Laszlo Reference Manual is itself a Laszlo application with many embedded live examples. And Laszlo in 10 Minutes with the Laszlo Explorer is one of the most amazing and educational hands-on demos: it walks you through key features of Laszlo, and actually lets you experiment with the example code, make changes, dynamically compile and instantly see the results as a running application.

What's the Future of OpenLaszlo?
OpenLaszlo is designed to use open standards, and built with open source tools and technologies. It's a high level architecture designed to target multiple rendering environments, and the first one it currently supports is Flash.

OpenLaszlo's platform independent architecture gives it the ability to target other runtime environments like DHTML, Java, XUL, Avalon, SVG, open source Flash players, cell phones and other embedded devices, as they become more powerful and mature. The Platform Roadmap describes the development goals and progress towards the next major release, which will include support for multiple runtimes, and many architectural improvements.

LZPIX OpenLaszlo DHTML AJAX Application


OpenLaszlo has announced that DHTML is the first alternative runtime.

LZPIX is an advanced AJAX photo sharing application that demonstrates how the same OpenLaszlo source code can be identically deployed with DHTML or Flash.

OpenLaszlo on a Cell Phone


OpenLaszlo applications can run on cell phones with the Flash 7 compatible Flash Lite 2 player for mobile devices, like the Nokia 6680.

Why Flash Now?
The Flash player itself is not open source, but it's freely available, often pre-installed, and widely deployed on 97% of user desktops. Its advantage over DHTML is that it's perfectly consistent across all platforms, and seamlessly supports many advanced multimedia features.

How Does OpenLaszlo Relate to Flash?
While OpenLaszlo takes advantage of Flash, it also gives you independence from it. Because of its architecture, it's not tied to Flash the way Macromedia Flex is. It will support future versions of Flash, as well as other platforms as they become more widespread. The Flash authoring tool may be used to develop content for OpenLaszlo applications, but it is not required.

What are Flash's Limitations?
Flash does not have a JavaScript source code compiler or interpreter built into the player. The Laszlo compiler and Flash authoring tool both translate JavaScript source code into byte code instructions (like Java), and combine them with multimedia resources into a binary SWF files, that the Flash player can execute.

The Flash player can only read a limited set of multimedia data types, with certain restrictions. Other data types must be transcoded or pre-converted into formats directly supported by Flash, like SWF and JPEG files. The new Flash player version 8 supports other formats like GIF, PNG and progressive JPEG, but it's wise to support older versions of the Flash player, when possible.

It has an XML parser, but it doesn't have native support for other XML standards like XPath or XSLT, like many web browsers. The OpenLaszlo runtime supports XPath, and provides data binding as an alternative to XSLT.

Security restrictions prevent the Flash player from fetching XML from hosts other than the one it downloaded the SWF file from. It requires a crossdomain.xml permission file to exist on other servers from which Flash downloads content or calls web services. This can be a problem for implementing interfaces to web services that you don't have control over, that don't support crossdomain.xml.

The solution is for the OpenLaszlo Server or PHP to act as a proxy for other servers. An intelligent proxy can go further by transforming the data or mashing it up with other web services, databases or utilities, to provide unique and exciting new web services.

Understanding Important OpenLaszlo Concepts
OpenLaszlo application source code is written in the "LZX" language, which is XML with embedded JavaScript code. Laszlo programs can also include reusable component libraries and resources in various formats such as audio, images, SWF vector graphics, animations, movies, fonts, rich text and XML data. The OpenLaszlo Server provides a compiler that translates text LZX programs, libraries and binary resources into binary SWF files that the Flash player can execute directly.

OpenLaszlo Server Features
The OpenLaszlo server has many features: dynamically compile, debug and optimize OpenLaszlo programs; act as a proxy for OpenLaszlo applications, so the Flash player can communicate with other servers; perform XML-RPC and SOAP calls; send and receive messages over persistent connections with other clients; transform XML into an efficient binary representation; transcode various file formats into SWF files that the Flash player can digest directly.

"SOLO" Mode
Networked OpenLaszlo applications can take advantage of the OpenLaszlo Server by running in "proxied mode". And you can also develop applications that run independently in "SOLO Mode" (Standalone OpenLaszlo Output). SOLO applications talk directly to your PHP server, or other XML web services like Flikr, Google Maps, etc. Self-contained OpenLaszlo programs can run without any network server at all. They can even be deployed as desktop applications.

XML Data
OpenLaszlo uses XML data for structuring programs, reusable component libraries, class definitions, resources, declaring JavaScript classes, methods and attributes, creating and configuring objects and data bindings. XML datasets can be efficiently precompiled into OpenLaszlo programs, or asynchronously downloaded from web services, and then automatically bound to JavaScript objects.

JavaScript Code
OpenLaszlo uses JavaScript code for defining scripts and method bodies, event handlers, attribute expressions (automatically updated constraints!), as well as representing objects, XML structures and graphical views as JavaScript dictionaries. Laszlo represents and manipulates XML as JavaScript object dictionaries, and has a sophisticated asynchronous XML data binding system that uses two-way constraints to tie the properties of JavaScript objects together with XML data, and drive the creation and replication of intelligent data bound Laszlo views.

Declarative Programming
Declarative programming is an elegant way of writing code that describes what to do, instead of how to do it. OpenLaszlo supports declarative programming in many ways: using XML to declare JavaScript classes, create object instances, configure them with automatic constraints, and bind them to XML datasets. Declarative programming dovetails and synergizes with other important OpenLaszlo techniques including objects, prototypes, events, constraints, data binding and instance first development.

Constraints
Constraints in OpenLaszlo are object attributes whose values are defined as functions of other object or XML data attributes. They're used to configure the relationships between objects, their attributes, and XML data. Like a spreadsheet, Laszlo conveniently keeps track of all dependencies, and automatically updates constraints when the values they depend on change. Constraints can refer to object attributes with JavaScript expressions, and also XML data with XPath expressions.

Automatic constraints are a wonderful feature, for the same reason that automatic garbage collection is great. They save programmers a huge amount of tedious error-prone effort and repetitive coding, by automatically and reliably performing intricate housekeeping tasks. They also make the code much more readable and concise, by letting you express what to do, instead of how to do it (which is the essence of declarative programming).

XML Data Binding
XML data bindings are XPath based constraints that create two-way connections between object attributes and XML data. When an XML data bound attribute is changed, the XML data and all constraints that depend on it are updated, so it's easy to implement automatic updating of multiple XML data views and editors.

XML data bindings can also cause the replication of exemplary Laszlo objects (prototypes), so you can declare how one object will look in terms of an XML element, and it will automatically replicate a separate instance for each XML element in the dataset.

Debugging OpenLaszlo Applications
To interactively explore and debug an OpenLaszlo application, run it with debugging enabled, by opening its URL with the "debug=true" parameter:

http://localhost/lzxnet/my-apps/helloworld.lzx?debug=true

That will load the application and open a Laszlo Debugger window, with an input text field at the bottom. First, click on the "Hello World" button to make sure it works. Then click in the text field at the bottom of the debugger window, type "responseText", and press return. The text you entered will be echoed in green, and then the debugger will print out the object as a blue hyperlink. Then, click in the debugger window on the object link "<<LzText#0| #responseText>>", and it will print out the attributes of the JavaScript object:

OpenLaszlo Debugger

All the blue attributes are links that you can click on, to examine their values. Try clicking on the "parent" attribute to look at the root canvas object, "<<LzCanvas#4| This is the canvas>>". Then you can explore the canvas's attributes, and look at all the JavaScript data structures that make up the application.

You can type JavaScript expressions into the debugger, and it will compile the expression and print out the result. You can type "responseText.visible" and press return, to see the current value of the visible attribute. Then enter the command "responseText.setAttribute('visible', false)", and notice that the responseText message disappears from the screen. Press the "Hello World" button again, and it will reappear!

The interactive debugger is an extremely powerful (and fun) tool for testing and debugging OpenLaszlo programs. The debugger window will show any runtime errors and warning messages in red text. You should always test out your programs in debug mode, and fix any problems that cause warnings or errors.

Another useful debugging technique is calling "Debug.write('message', value, ...)". That function takes any number of arguments of any type, and it prints them out to the debugger window, showing any object or array values you pass as blue hypertext links. That makes it easy to click on the debugger log to examine objects of interest.

Spice up PHP applications with OpenLaszlo


Nicholas Chase an I have just written a three part tutorial for the IBM DeveloperWorks web site, about using OpenLaszlo and PHP to develop a distributed Knock Knock Joke (Ha! or Not!) application.

This "Spice up PHP applications with OpenLaszlo" tutorial series shows you how to use OpenLaszlo to create a more interactive interface for your PHP applications and how to use PHP to create more dynamic OpenLaszlo applications. It requires a basic understanding of -- or willingness to learn -- XML, JavaScript, and PHP. Each is well worth knowing for its own merits, plus they plug and play together nicely, since they're all based on synergistic open standards.

This series chronicles the creation of a rating system for knock-knock jokes ("Ha! or Not!"). Part 1 has been published, and the others are in the pipeline and will appear soon.

Part 1 talks about the knock-knock protocol, discusses ReSTian protocol design, and covers the creation of the basic PHP application and a simple OpenLaszlo interface, with graphics and sound, for that application.

Part 2 will discuss deployment options, and show the creation of the OpenLaszlo application as a stand-alone piece that can be deployed on any Web server and communicate directly with a PHP application.

Part 3 expands the application to create a system in which PHP stores the jokes and votes in an SQL database, and creates the OpenLaszlo code dynamically.

You will learn about PHP and OpenLaszlo, how to set up the development environment, and create a basic OpenLaszlo application that will serve as an interface for a joke rating service. OpenLaszlo is a free XML/JavaScript-based Web application programming language that enables you to write interactive multimedia applications that can ultimately be deployed to the browser in many ways. Currently, the target environment is a Flash movie, playable on virtually any modern browser without user intervention.

Constraints and Prototypes in Garnet and Laszlo

I originally wrote this article on September 18, 2005. Laszlo and Garnet are no longer active projects, but they both had some great ideas that can be applied to other systems!

Garnet is an advanced user interface development environment written in Common Lisp, developed by Brad Meyers (the author of the article). I worked for Brad on the Garnet project at the CMU CS department back in 1992–3.

One thing I like about Brad Meyers is that he’s a strong programmer, as well as an excellent researcher, so he had a first-hand understanding of the real-world issues involved in programming languages and user interface architecture, unlike many academics who talk a lot of theory but never get their hands dirty. Brad Meyers understands where the rubber hits the road, and how important it is to have good tires.

At the time I worked on it, Garnet didn’t have pretty graphics like Flash, but the underlying programming system had some advanced features that are sorely lacking from most modern user interface development environments.

Laszlo is an modern open source GUI programming system, with many of Garnet’s advanced “natural programming” features like prototypes and constraints. Laszlo currently uses Flash as its virtual machine, but it’s a much higher level way to program dynamic interactive web based applications, without using the proprietary Flash authoring tool.

Garnet had a true prototype based OOP system (somewhat like Self), which is great for gui programming, because guis have so many objects that look and behave like each other except for a few little customizations (like the layout, graphical style, data source and call-back behavior).

Garnet also had an automatic constraint system, which enabled you to simply define any attribute as a formula that depend on other attributes, without needing to worry about how and when the values were calculated. Garnet’s constraint system automatically figured out the dependences of each formula, and automatically and efficiently recalculated and cached any values that needed to be updated, but only when necessary.

With constraints, you can make a button inside a window, and define its left edge to be ((parent.width — self.width) / 2), and it will automatically remain horizontally centered in the window from then on, without you (the programmer) having to worry about what to do when the parent window’s size changes.

Without constraints, you have to manually write all the code that changes the button position whenever the window size changes, which results in code scattered all over the place in different classes and handlers and intermediate objects.

Constraints are much easier to use and more general purpose than resize handlers, springs and struts, complex MVC updating schemes, and other Rube Goldberg devices.

Constraints are especially useful for user interface programming, because they save you from having to write lots of annoying boiler plate and error prone code for handling updates (registering, chasing down dependencies, detecting changes, notifying updates, all happens automatically).

Constraints make GUI programming much easier, but they’re also useful anywhere in your program where one value is defined in terms of other values that might change at any time.

Once you’ve tasted a programming language with constraints, you will not want to go back. Programming without constraints is like writing in machine language: error prone, low level, tedious, inefficient and mind numbing.

Constraints are like structured programming for variables: In the same way that it’s better to use loops and conditionals instead of gotos, it’s also better to use declarative programming that says what you mean, instead of imperative peeks and pokes and side effects.

Constraints let you write easy to read code, and concentrate on the interesting high level stuff that matters. You can go back later and change the layout of a complex GUI, without rewriting lots of fragile layout and event hanling code. Look at any MFC program to see how bad it can get without constraints.

Constraints are natural and close to the way you think, because they let you declare a variable and the formula that defines its value in one place, instead of scattered all around the code. They off-load the tedious task of tracking down and maintaining all the dependencies from the programmer to the computer, which is much better at that kind of stuff.

Garbage collection is like constraints: the computer can do a much better job than the human at performing the task perfectly, so spending some cpu time on automatic garbage collection and constraint maintenance is well worth the significant increase in programmer productivity and software reliability.

Garnet had a prototype based object system. It was implemented in Lisp with a system called KR (Knowledge Representation, classic AI “frames” with slots and inheritance). KR was extended with an automatic constraint system that parsed the formula expressions (written in Lisp macros), figured out the dependences, wired up and maintained the dependency graph.

An expression like “((parent.width — self.width) / 2)” would depend on self’s width slot, self’s parent slot, and parent’s width slot. If any of them changed, then that formula would be automatically invalidated, and only recalculated on demand when it (or something that depended on it) is required.

The cool thing was that you can make a prototype object, like a button, which has sub-structures like a label, border, drop shadow, etc. The sub-structures can be constrained to the button’s dimensions, the label is centered in the border, and the drop shadow floats below and to the right, so the button’s layout is automatically updated when it moves or resizes.

The text color and border fill can depend on the button’s “hilight” variable, so they automatically switch between bright and dark when you press the button (the input handler just toggles the “highlight” variable, and the graphics that depend on it are automatically updated).

Now that you’ve composed and constrained a button to look and feel how you want, you can use it as a prototype to make other similar customizable buttons instances. Each instance can itself override the prototype’s graphical properties, label text, action, etc.

Instances of a prototype all magically inherit (instances of) the sub-structure of the prototype! It all just works the way you’d expect it to (with a lot of plumbing going on automatically behind the scenes). There’s no need to make a separate class for each different style of button or action — prototypes let you customize any instance itself!

Like Garnet, Laszlo is an advanced open source user interface development environment that supports prototype based OOP with constraints.

Unlike Garnet, Laszlo deeply integrates recent trendy technologies like XML, JavaScript, Flash, data binding, networking, XML/RPC, SOAP, ReST, Java and Tomcat.

Laszlo has a class/prototype based object system, and it (currently) uses the JavaScript runtime in Flash as its virtual machine. But it’s more than just another way to program Flash.

Unlike raw Flash, The Laszlo language is easy to learn and Laszlo programs are easy to read and write thanks to prototypes, constraints, declarative programming, and instance-first development.

My remark was just an old Java joke I repurposed for Ant!
"Java is a DSL for taking large XML files and converting them to stack traces." -Andrew Back

https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eaqgk/java_is_...

But in all seriousness:

OpenLaszlo used XML with embedded JavaScript in a way that let you extend XML by defining your own tags in XML+JavaScript. I've done a lot of work with it, and once you make your peace with XML (which seemed like a prudent thing to do at the time), it's a really productive enjoyable way to program! But that's more thanks to the design of OpenLaszlo itself, rather than XML.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLaszlo

OpenLaszlo (which was released in 2001) inspired Adobe Flex (which was released in 2004), but Flex missed the point of several of the most important aspects of OpenLaszlo (first and foremost being cross platform and not locking you into Flash, which was the entire point of Flex, but also the declarative constraints and "Instance First Development" and the "Instance Substitution Principal", as defined by Oliver Steele).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex

https://blog.osteele.com/2004/03/classes-and-prototypes/

The mantle of constraint based programming (but not Instance First Development) has been recently taken up by "Reactive Programming" craze (which is great, but would be better with a more homoiconic language that supported Instance First Development and the Instance Substitution Principle, which are different but complementary features with a lot of synergy). The term "Reactive Programming" describes a popular old idea: what spreadsheets had been doing for decades.

OpenLaszlo and Garnet (a research user interface system written by Brad Myers at CMU in Common Lisp) were exploring applying automatic constraints to user interface programming. Garnet started in the early 1990's. Before that, Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad explored constraints in 1963, and inspired the Visual Geometry Project in the mid 1980's and The Geometer's Sketchpad in 1995.

I've written more about OpenLaszlo and Garnet:

What is OpenLaszlo, and what's it good for?

https://web.archive.org/web/20160312145555/http://donhopkins...

>Declarative Programming: Declarative programming is an elegant way of writing code that describes what to do, instead of how to do it. OpenLaszlo supports declarative programming in many ways: using XML to declare JavaScript classes, create object instances, configure them with automatic constraints, and bind them to XML datasets. Declarative programming dovetails and synergizes with other important OpenLaszlo techniques including objects, prototypes, events, constraints, data binding and instance first development.

>That was also one of the rationales behind TCL's design. John Ousterhout explained in one of his early TCL papers that, as a "Tool Command Language" like the shell but unlike Lisp, arguments were treated as quoted literals by default (presuming that to be the common case), so you don't have to put quotes around most strings, and you have to use punctuation like ${}[] to evaluate expressions.

>TCL's syntax is optimized for calling functions with literal parameters to create and configure objects, like a declarative configuration file. And it's often used that way with Tk to create and configure a bunch of user interface widgets.

>Oliver Steel has written some interesting stuff about "Instance-First Development" and how it applies to the XML/JavaScript based OpenLaszlo programming language, and other prototype based languages.

>Instance-First Development: https://blog.osteele.com/2004/03/classes-and-prototypes/

>The equivalence between the two programs above supports a development strategy I call instance-first development. In instance-first development, one implements functionality for a single instance, and then refactors the instance into a class that supports multiple instances.

>[...] In defining the semantics of LZX class definitions, I found the following principle useful:

>Instance substitution principal: An instance of a class can be replaced by the definition of the instance, without changing the program semantics.

>In OpenLaszlo, you can create trees of nested instances with XML tags, and when you define a class, its name becomes an XML tag you can use to create instances of that class.

>That lets you create your own domain specific declarative XML languages for creating and configuring objects (using constraint expressions and XML data binding, which makes it very powerful).

>The syntax for creating a bunch of objects is parallel to the syntax of declaring a class that creates the same objects.

>So you can start by just creating a bunch of stuff in "instance space", then later on as you see the need, easily and incrementally convert only the parts of it you want to reuse and abstract into classes.

>I think one thing holding back constraint programming is that they require an interpreter or compiler to understand them, or the programmer to write code in a constrained syntax.

>Garnet's KR constraints are written as Lisp expressions implemented by Lisp macros, that parse the expressions and recognize certain expressions like "gvl" for "get value", and named path expressions. KR wires up the dependency graph based on that information, and marks the constraint as invalid if any of the links along the dependency path change, as well as when any of the final values the expressions reference change. But it doesn't understand the mathematical expressions themselves. At the time I was working on it, it didn't know hot to figure out which branches of conditional expressions mattered, so it would assume it depended on everything in the expression. (i.e. like the C expression "size = window.landscape ? parent.width : parent.height" -- if window.landscape is true, it depends on parent.width, else it depends on parent.height, but ). It only recalculates the constraint values lazily when you read them. ("pull" constraints).

>OpenLaszlo constraints are written as JavaScript expressions that the OpenLaszlo compiler parses, and it creates some JavaScript data and hidden methods behind the scenes that go along with the class, which are used at runtime to keep track of all the dependencies. You don't have to use a special expressions in constraints to read values, but you do have to use object.setValue("key", value) to write values. (This was because OpenLaszlo was targeting the Flash runtime, and that was the most efficient trade-off, since Flash didn't support property setters like modern JavaScript does.)

>OpenLaszlo constraints used a "push" model of propagating all dependent changes forward when you called "setValue", because that was the best trade-off at the time for speed and usability and how it was intended to be used. But with getters and setters you could implement a more convenient constraint system that didn't put so many constraints on the programmer and how you use them.

Reminds me of Genshi, which was really cool about.... 15 years ago. https://pythonhosted.org/Genshi/templates.html
The big difference between Genshi and Jinja (which ended up winning) is that Genshi templates are valid XHTML using the "py:" XML namespace for control flow, and Jinja templates use their own syntax (and therefore can template things other than XML).

I love Genshi, and still occasionally maintain a big Python project that uses it for several purposes (generating html, and processing xml from and to various formats)!
Genshi was based on an earlier Python XML templating system called Kid, which is what TurboGears used by default, before switching to Genshi.

You write Genshi templates as XML (although it also supports plain text templates), and it had serializers that translated the xml streams your templates produce to xhtml or different varieties of html.

Genshi is also great for generating other formats of xml, much easier to use and more powerful than XSLT.

For example, I used it to generate tediously repetitive and low level VML and CCML files for an interactive voice response system, by writing high level Genshi macros and xml data, which felt a lot like Lisp programming!

Genshi is so simple (which makes it easy to learn and use), it would be trivial to implement a Genshi-compatible xml processor in JavaScript, using JavaScript expressions to evaluate strings for if conditionals, variable bindings, etc.

It may be 15 years old, but I'd joyfully use Genshi again to transform XML to XML, long before I ever considered coming within a mile of XSLT (yech).

My impression of XSLT is that there were representatives from every different programming language paradigm on the XSLT standard committee, and each one of them was able to get just enough of what was special about their own paradigm into the standard to showcase it while sabotaging the others and making them all look foolish, but not enough to actually get any work done or lord forbid synergistically dovetail together into a unified whole.

The only way I was ever able to get anything done with XLST was to use Microsoft's script extensions to drop down into JavaScript and just solve the problem with a few lines of code. And that begs the question of why am I not just solving this problem with a few lines of JavaScript code instead of inviting XSLT to the party?

But for generating HTML with JavaScript/TypeScript now, I prefer Svelte. But partially because it has a lot of similarities with Genshi and OpenLaszlo.

OpenLaszlo is another XML/JavaScript based programming language I really enjoyed using, but that's now obsolete. It was a lot like Adobe FLEX, but it existed before FLEX, and it was designed to abstract the Flash player away instead of locking you into the Flash player like FLEX was. You wrote xml files with embedded JavaScript (ActionScript for FLEX) scripts and expressions. And the Laszlo compiler could compile it into either a .flv file that ran in the Flash player, or JavaScript/HTML that ran identically in the web browser.

I've written about OpenLaszlo before. (Excerpting old posts and updating broken links to archive.org):

DonHopkins on May 16, 2014 | parent | context | favorite | on: What web developers thought of in the noughties as...

Some alternatives to MVC for user interface programming that I've used and love are constraints / data binding / events and delegates.

I worked on the internals of "Garnet", a constraint based user interface management system written in Common Lisp on X11 (Brad Meyers' research system developed in the 90's at CMU) -- http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/garnet/www/papers.html -- and also on the internals and applications of "OpenLaszlo", an open source cross platform XML/JavaScript based web programming system that supports Flash and browser JavaScript/HTML.

https://web.archive.org/web/20070810113039/http://www.donhop...

Here is an article I wrote about constraints in OpenLaszlo and Garnet: Constraints and Prototypes in Garnet and Laszlo

https://web.archive.org/web/20070823205654/http://www.donhop...

Oliver Steele (one of the architects of OpenLaszlo, and a great Lisp programmer) describes how OpenLaszlo supports "instance first development" and "rethinking MVC": http://osteele.com/archives/2004/03/classes-and-prototypes http://osteele.com/archives/2003/08/rethinking-mvc

I've used OpenLaszlo a lot, and I will testify that the "instance first" technique that Oliver describes is great fun, works very well, and it's perfect for the kind of exploratory / productizing programming I like to do. (Like tacking against the wind, first exploring by creating instances, then refactoring into reusable building block classes, then exploring further with those...)

OpenLaszlo's declarative syntax, prototype based object system, xml data binding and constraints support that directly and make it easy.

OpenLaszlo's declarative syntax and compiler directly support instance first development (with a prototype based object system) and constraints (built on top of events and delegates -- the compiler parses the constraint expressions and automatically wires up dependences), in a way that is hard to express elegantly in less dynamic, reflective languages. (Of course it was straightforward for Garnet to do with Common Lisp macros!)

I meant that Ant is built on a generic language for representing data. But XML isn't a great choice and JSON wouldn't work well either. S-expressions are popular with Lisp programmers and unpopular with most other people.

It seems like there might be some other solution?

My remark was just an old Java joke I repurposed for Ant! "Java is a DSL for taking large XML files and converting them to stack traces." -Andrew Back

But in all seriousness:

OpenLaszlo used XML with embedded JavaScript in a way that let you extend XML by defining your own tags in XML+JavaScript. I've done a lot of work with it, and once you make your peace with XML (which seemed like a prudent thing to do at the time), it's a really productive enjoyable way to program! But that's more thanks to the design of OpenLaszlo itself, rather than XML.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLaszlo

OpenLaszlo (which was released in 2001) inspired Adobe Flex (which was released in 2004), but Flex missed the point of several of the most important aspects of OpenLaszlo (first and foremost being cross platform and not locking you into Flash, which was the entire point of Flex, but also the declarative constraints and "Instance First Development" and the "Instance Substitution Principal", as defined by Oliver Steele).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex

https://blog.osteele.com/2004/03/classes-and-prototypes/

The mantle of constraint based programming (but not Instance First Development) has been recently taken up by "Reactive Programming" craze (which is great, but would be better with a more homoiconic language that supported Instance First Development and the Instance Substitution Principle, which are different but complementary features with a lot of synergy). The term "Reactive Programming" describes a popular old idea: what spreadsheets had been doing for decades.

OpenLaszlo and Garnet (a research user interface system written by Brad Myers at CMU in Common Lisp) were exploring applying automatic constraints to user interface programming. Garnet started in the early 1990's. Before that, Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad explored constraints in 1963, and inspired the Visual Geometry Project in the mid 1980's and The Geometer's Sketchpad in 1995.

I've written more about OpenLaszlo and Garnet:

What is OpenLaszlo, and what's it good for?

>Declarative Programming: Declarative programming is an elegant way of writing code that describes what to do, instead of how to do it. OpenLaszlo supports declarative programming in many ways: using XML to declare JavaScript classes, create object instances, configure them with automatic constraints, and bind them to XML datasets. Declarative programming dovetails and synergizes with other important OpenLaszlo techniques including objects, prototypes, events, constraints, data binding and instance first development.

Self-closing tags would make more sense here, i.e.
   <v $foo />

	
marianoguerra on Jan 16, 2022 | parent | next [–]

I found some references here:
"Custom elements cannot be self-closing because HTML only allows a few elements to be self-closing"

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-component...

It seems only void elements are allowed to be self closing:

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elem...

The trailing U+002F (/) in a start tag name can be used only in foreign content to specify self-closing tags. (Self-closing tags don't exist in HTML.) It is also allowed for void elements, but doesn't have any effect in this case.

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parse-er...


	
tannhaeuser on Jan 16, 2022 | root | parent | next [–]

The important bit here being that the custom element API simply doesn't allow declaring all relevant features of elements except their names.
Whereas (SGML) DTDs such as in any DTD for HTML before HTML5, elements were declared like this

    <!element img - - EMPTY>
for elements with declared content EMPTY ("void elements" in HTML5 parlance), and
    <!element html O O
     (head,body)>
as a basic example for tag omission/inference, where given these tag omission indicators (the letter O in the respective position), you can omit the html tags (and also head, and many other start- and end-element tags) when SGML can unambiguously infer those for you.

Valid custom elements must also contain a dash.

	
wvenable on Jan 16, 2022 | parent | prev | next [–]

HTML doesn't have self-closing tags.
To down voters: No seriously, it doesn't. XHTML has self-closing tags but HTML does not. It will happily ignore your self-closing tags if you have them but it accomplishes nothing. Self closing tags lived and died with XHTML.


	
JimDabell on Jan 16, 2022 | root | parent | next [–]

It does. From the HTML5 specification:
> Then, if the element is one of the void elements, or if the element is a foreign element, then there may be a single U+002F SOLIDUS character (/). This character has no effect on void elements, but on foreign elements it marks the start tag as self-closing.

— https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#start-tag...

> It will happily ignore your self-closing tags if you have them but it accomplishes nothing.

Sure. They are optional for HTML elements. That’s not the same thing as “HTML doesn’t have them”. HTML has them, understands them, and chooses to only do something with them for foreign elements.

The problem with using it in this situation is not that HTML doesn’t have self-closing tags, it’s that custom elements cannot be void elements.


	
wvenable on Jan 16, 2022 | root | parent | next [–]

Foreign elements are elements from XML namespaces so obviously XML rules apply.
> That’s not the same thing as “HTML doesn’t have them”.

HTML has always ignored them. They have no affect on any HTML element. If you attempt to use them as in XML, on normal elements, they do not close that element. If you use them on void elements, they obviously also do nothing. It's utterly meaningless in HTML.


	
JimDabell on Jan 16, 2022 | root | parent | next [–]

> HTML has always ignored them.
No, browsers have always ignored them.

Until HTML5 came along, they were the start of a NET. It was incorrect syntax that would probably end up causing a parse error later in the document thus mangling it. However because browsers didn't fully comply with SGML-based HTML parsing, the mangling didn’t happen and the result was that this syntax mistake would have no effect. Two bugs cancelling each other out.

That is a different situation to HTML5, which explicitly states that it’s an acceptable no-op.

“This is okay, but you don’t need to do anything with it” is a different situation to “This is a NET” followed by “I don’t know what a NET is, so I’m going to mis-parse it as an attribute and then ignore it because it makes no sense as an attribute”.

it seems the DOMParser doesn't allow custom self closing tags, I tried and it didn't work

Ha! Do you plan on using it for practical stuff?

	
marianoguerra on Jan 16, 2022 | parent | next [–]

No, I wanted to try the DOMParser API and build a programming language that was valid HTML and would be closest to the HTML spirit, that's why I built the expressions as a stack language, to avoid introducing syntax for arithmentic, comparison and boolean expressions. It would be much concise with custom syntax for that but further away from HTML

Video Tape Transcript of Toronto Usenix Symposium Keynote Address
This is a transcript of a video taped keynote address in absentia, for the Toronto Usenix Symposium. The normal text is Don Hopkins talking. The (parenthetcal italic text) is extra annotation and explanation that's not on the video tape.


-- Beginning of Video Tape --



Hello, my name is Don Hopkins, and I ported SimCity to Unix on top of X11 using the TCL/Tk toolkit, and also on top of the NeWS window system using HyperLook. Unfortunately I can't be in Toronto to demonstrate this stuff to you, but fortunately I have some video tapes that you can see that demonstrate the whole system.



The X11 version of SimCity is multi player, and several people can join the game, and cooperate, and people draw roads, and put down buildings in different places, and then when you do something important, like change the tax rate, or build an airport, you have to get everybody else who's playing to agree where to put it, and which thing to put down. So it makes you slow down and rationalize what you're doing, and explain to people why it is you want to put it there. It's a really interesting addition to SimCity because it adds politics.



I'm going to show first the X11 version, which is on top of TCL/Tk, and that's a free toolkit that's available, written by John Ousterhaut at Berkeley. There's a book that's coming out describing it, and you can just get TCL/Tk and use it to make products for free. You don't have to pay anything for it, and it's actually very good code. It really beats the pants off of Motif, and we were able to modify it in order to support things like colormaps and multiple displays the way we needed to, and add things to it like a sound server to make sound effects, and pie menus for quickly selecting city editing tools. TCL/Tk made alot of sense for SimCity.



The first port of SimCity that I did to Unix is on HyperLook, which is an interactive graphical environment based on NeWS. We took the source code to SimCity for the Mac, and I threw away all the user interface code written in C, and just took the core simulator, and then rewrote the user interface using HyperLook, which is this direct manipulation graphical environment, kind of like HyperCard, where you can take pictures and paste them in to define the look, and then every object has a script on it that in HyperLook, the script is PostScript, which defines its behavior.



So you just create a user interface by drawing it, and then hook it up to the application, and that user interface is separated from the application, and they send messages back and forth. Now this separation of the user interface from the application is really important, and that made it much easier later to port SimCity to X11.

HyperLook has this scripting language in it, and TCL/Tk has the TCL scripting language in it, so I was able to translate the things I had written in PostScript into TCL, and have a very similar structure. It makes it much easier to develop a thing as complex as SimCity if you have an interpretive programming language there, so you can just fiddle around, and paste new function definitions into the running system.

There are some user interface editors that have been developed for TCL/Tk, but I just wrote code by hand because I was doing some more specialized things, like multiple views and putting up views on different X11 displays over the net, that the user interface editors didn't support. HyperLook has a built in user interface editor, and I'll demonstrate HyperLook SimCity and the HyperLook environment in the following video tape.



The X11 version of SimCity supports multi player, so you can add several people to the same game, and it connects up like an octopus, several X11 displays connected to one X11 client. You can cooperate on these important decisions like setting taxes and building airports. Everybody's participating in the same game and lives with the consequences of each others actions, so now you have politics in the game. There are some tools for communicating and drawing on the map, and seeing what other people are doing.



Unix was very good for porting SimCity because it's a very good programming environment. It's very difficult and lacking in multimedia things like the sound, and just doing animation easily.

I had to create alot of things that didn't exist before, that other people are independantly working on creating too. That stuff is slowly fading into view, like for example there's the NetAudio server now that lets two programs make sounds at once, it just mixes them together.

SimCity wants to go "Roar!", "Roar!", "Kaboom!", and my email program wants to go "dinga linga linga ling" at the same time, so you have to have one program handling the sound that mixes them.



One of the things I developed for TCL/Tk and for HyperLook was this sound mixer server. And then we got an NCD X-Terminal, and just layered my sound mixer on top of their sound server. It can either use the built-in audio device and be a TCL sound server, or it can use the sound server that's in your X-Terminal or your Sun or SGI or whatever, if you're running NetAudio.

There are some other hard problems to solve like the bitmap animation. X has some extensions like shared memory, that make it easy to animate, but you can't depend on it, and some peoples servers don't have quite the whole shared memory extension. It's just a pretty frightening prospect just trying to write pixels onto the screen. You have to deal with about 50 different possible combinations of different display devices, and different ways of getting to that display device.

It's very difficult programming this stuff under X. It was alot more fun doing it in NeWS. We had to give up alot of the neat graphical features for the X version that we had in the NeWS version, like scaling and zooming around. You just can't do that in X. Unfortunately, NeWS is dead. There's no longer any support for it. The thing that was really wrong with it was that it was not cross platform. You were just stuck on Suns.





The good news though is that there are much better systems, I'm working on one right now at Kaleida called ScriptX, that are cross platform. Their whole purpose in life is to provide you a really nice high level abstraction, that lets you ignore which operating system you're running on, so instead of developing for Unix, or for MS-DOS, or for the Mac, you would develop for ScriptX, and that would get you to Unix, and the Mac, and MS-DOS. More interestingly, that would get you to things that don't exist yet, that are just coming into existance, things like set top boxes with really hot graphics, and nicer systems than you're currently even dreaming about.



What we need are high level multimedia abstractions; the X graphics model is very low level, and just doesn't work, but the NeWS PostScript graphics model is really nice, but we want the best of both worlds: a high level system that runs fast on lots of platforms. Once we have a truely object oriented system, things start plugging and playing like Legos, as this video tape of the HyperLook system will demonstrate.

The good news is that in the future, we will have systems like this that plug and play with each other over the network, and it won't matter what kind of hardware you're using. And that'll be in the hands of consumers too, it won't be just for Unix weenies.

I will show you a video tape of a talk that I gave at Interval, about "Self Revealing Gestural Interfaces", which is computer jargon for "pie menus". That is a thing that I put into both version of SimCity that lets you select editing tools really quickly.





One of the nice things about running on a fast platform, is that SimCity runs really fast, and now it's a question of keeping up with the simulator. You need a streamlined user interface in order to keep up with this city that's zooming years into the future at you sit. That's what the pie menus are for, and I'll demonstrate that.



For the pie menus and the multi player interaction stuff, like putting up windows on different screens and letting people have a shared view of this one environment, it was really nice to have the source code to the TCL/Tk toolkit, in order to support that kind of stuff.

It wouldn't have been possible to port SimCity to X11 using Open Software Foundation's Motif toolkit. It just absolutely sucks. It's not open, and you have to pay for the source code, and it's not being maintained.

But there's a really wonderful community that's grown around TCL/Tk, and people are allowed to use it in their products for free, and get the source code. I implemented pie menus with TCL/Tk for SimCity, and out of gratitude, I put the source code for the pie menu module out for other people to use, just to help to community. It's a nice positive feedback situation, as opposed to the cold war situation you have with COSE, Motif, and Open Software Foundation.

We bundled the HyperLook runtime system with the NeWS version of SimCity. If you're running OpenWindows 3.0, you can get it and try it out.



We have been distributing SimCity over the Internet, and (less successfully) on CDROMs. That's possible because Unix systems have serial numbers, so we can node lock SimCity, and you can run the program for five minutes if you don't have a license, and then it melts, so you get the whole feel of the whole full blown product, and if you like it, then you call up DUX Software's 800 number, give them your credit card number, tell them your serial number, and they tell you a password to type in that will unlock it for your particular machine, then you're up and playing SimCity. No physical transaction has taken place. You're encouraged to get a copy of it over the net, and give it to your friends.

This is the best way to distribute software. Whenever we make updates, we can just put them right online, and people can just grab a new copy. I think that's the future of software distribution. I don't like the little boxes with plastic insets and little pieces of cardboard folded up to make then seem heavier and thicker. The instant gratification of distributing it over the net is really great.

Well, anyway, here's the talk, and the video tapes.

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."



I'm Don Hopkins from DUX Software, demonstrating multi user SimCity for Unix, running on X11 on an Indigo workstation, based on the original SimCity by Will Wright from Maxis.

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."



On the left is an overall map window, and on the right is a close-up animated view. You can pan the animated view around, by dragging the yellow rectangle on the map. Then you can edit with the bulldozer, and build.

"Rumble, crash!" (Destroy a building with the bulldozer.)

"Residential." (Select the Residential zoning icon from the pallet, and zone some land.)

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic." (Oh no, that helicopter won't shut up!)

You can pan by dragging the middle button, directly, without moving to the scroll bars, which don't exist. And you can select from the pallet of editing tools, by pressing on the icon.

"Road." (Select the Road building icon from the pallet, and make some roads.)

"Wire." (Now string some electrical wires to hook up to the power grid.)

"Police Station." (Keep the donut shops in business.)

Or clicking the right button, and popping up a pie menu.

(Check out my Pie Menu Page, for more information about pie menus!)

"Whoosh! Zone? Fire Station." (Press the right mouse button to "whoosh" up a pie menu. Select the Zone submenu, then select Fire Station icon from that.)



"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."

"Whoosh! Wire."

"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Crash, crash, rumble, crash!"

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."

"Whoosh! Zone? Industrial."



"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Rumble, rumble, rumble!"

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."

"Whoosh! Build? Nuclear Power."



"Whoosh! Road."

"Whoosh! Wire."

Pie menus work with mouse-ahead. If I remember the direction, I can press down, move, and release, to select without showing the menu.

"Whoosh! Road." (No pie menu appears on the screen, but we hear the feedback and it selects the icon!)

"Whoosh! Rail." (See, easy!)

"Whoosh! Bulldozer." (Believe me, you get used to it!)

Or I can always pause, to see ... the menu.

"Whoosh! ... Road." (You can always see the menu if you need to.)

"Whoosh! Zone? ... Fire Station."

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."

"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Rumble, crash!"



"Whoosh! Zone? Industrial."

(Pan on over to the Panhandle, in Haight Ashbury, east of Golden Gate Park.)

"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Rumble, rumble, rumble."

(Clear away some park in the Panhandle.)



"Whoosh! Road."

(Fix up the part of Oak Street that we accidentally destroyed.)

"Whoosh! Zone? Residential."

(Put down a residential zone in the park.)

"Whoosh! Wire."

(Wire the new zone onto the power grid.)

"Whoosh! Zone? Park."

(Put park land back down around the residential zone.)

"Whoosh! Zone? Residential."

(Put down another residential zone in the park.)

"Whoosh! Wire."

(Wire the zone to the power grid.)

"Whoosh! Zone? Park."

(Put more parks around the new zone.)



"Whoosh! Rail."

"Skywatch One reporting heavy traffic."

(Put a railroad down along the north edge of park next to Fell Street.)

(The train appears and starts heading down the railroad, as it's being drawn.)

(Oh no, we're missing one piece of rail because there was a fountain in the way!)

(The train is heading for the fountain! Quick, pie menus to the rescue!)



"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Rumble, rumble."

(Bulldoze the fountain out of the way.)

"Whoosh! Rail."

(Put down the rail just in time, right under the wheels of the oncoming train!)



"Whoosh! Rail."

"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Rumble, rumble."

"Whoosh! Rail."

(Make a little maze of railroad tracks to keep the train busy while we bulldoze another couple of fountains and lay down the rest of the track.)



"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Rumble, rumble, rumble, rumble!"

"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Whoosh! Build? Airport."

"Whoosh! Oop."

(Build an airport in the middle of the Panhandle.)



"Whoosh! Road."

(Build an access road to the airport from Fell Street.)

"Whoosh! Bulldozer."

"Whoosh! Wire."

(Hook the airport up to the power grid.)

"Whoosh! Road."

"Whoosh! Zone? Park."

(Airport's radar starts spinning, as the train rolls back down the track.)

Video Tape of Toronto Usenix Address
Video Tape of HyperLook SimCity Demo

Video Tape Transcript of HyperLook SimCity Demo
This is a transcript of a video taped demonstration of SimCity on HyperLook
in NeWS. The normal text is Don Hopkins talking. The "quoted italic text" is Abbe Don talking, who's running the camera. The (parenthetcal italic text) is extra annotation and explanation that's not on the video tape.

-- Beginning of Video Tape --

This is the HyperLook user interface system, written in NeWS, and it's running on a Sun on OpenWindows 3.0, and this is SimCity, and application that I ported to HyperLook.



Now we can press a button to play a city, and it will load a map of that.

This is the overall map view, and this is the editor.



I can drag this rectangle around to scroll the map.

And then I can throw it, and it has some inertia, so it bounces around.

And then with this "Zoom" button here, I can zoom my view in, to look closer and closer into the map, so that we're actually scooting around quite close to the city.



And then, we can actually edit in this scale. (Wee!) Put some roads down. I think you can get even closer. And then you can zoom out.



All this is written in PostScript, all the graphics. The SimCity engine is in C, but all the user interface and the graphics are in PostScript.

The neat thing about doing something like this in HyperLook is that HyperLook is kind of like HyperCard, in that all of the user interface is editable. So these windows we're looking at here are like stacks, that we can edit.

Now I'll flip this into edit mode, while the program's running. That's a unique thing.

Now I'm in edit mode, and this reset button here is just a user interface component that I can move around, and I can hit the "Props" key, and get a property sheet on it.

I'll show you what it really is. See, every one of these HyperLook objects has a property sheet, and you can define its graphics. I'll zoom in here. We have this nice PostScript graphics editor, and we could turn it upside down, or sideways, or, you know, like that. Or scale it. I'll just undo, that's pretty useful.



This just defines what the button looks like. Here, there's a flip function: Special... Flip Top/Bottom. I'll just center them, and apply, and now we have a little upside-down reset button.

So we have these Open Look components up here. I'll put this into edit mode. See, I can highlight all the components.

HyperLook is integrated with The NeWS Toolkit, so we can get all these ancient looking Open Look menus and what not, and do things like cut this slider out here, and stick it onto here, to set the tax rate.



This slider happens to set the transportation fund. Every interface object here has a script that defines its behavior, and this guy says his action is to send the SetTransportationFund message to MyStack. The scripting language for the HyperLook system is PostScript, and some people complained about that, so Arthur van Hoff wrote a C to PostScript compiler, so that they can program in C. But however, I'd rather program in PostScript, myself.

Woops. Let me put the button back on the window. There's quite a possibility for user interface vandalism in this system, so what we've done is make the user interface editor be just a user interface component that's in the stack, that you can remove to make the stack not editable. I've done some amount of magic to make SimCity editable, but when it's delivered as a product, it's just with a runtime system and not editable.

We will go back and turn on Auto-Budget. Ok, now this is showing us something's happened, and I can click in here to bring my other view there.

The neat thing is that this view here itself is just another user interface component, and I can copy and paste that, and have multiple views. Each one of these animated scrolling SimCity editors, once I've made one, I can put them anywhere. This window, you can click here to get three of them.



I put this nice high level component into this user interface system, and now anybody can just cut and paste it.

One of the neat components that HyperLook comes with is the graphics editor, which is pretty ubiquituous. Like if I were to edit this button by hitting the properties key, I get this property sheet that has a graphics editor in it.

Now this property sheet itself is a stack that I can edit. So its graphics editor, the menu here, and all this stuff is just fair play.



So when you make a new component class, you also construct another property sheet for it, or just copy one that almost does what you want, and then edit it so that it has the new things.

That completely separates this notion of property sheets from the user interface, because you can just plug in a new set of property sheets that have a different look and feel, like if you want to give more novice people the ability to edit their user interface, you could have a simpler set of property sheets.

So now we're going to get weird. I'm going to pause SimCity so it doesn't take all the CPU time, and iconify it. And of course, when you iconify it, the icons are miniatures of the window, and they're active too, so when I scroll these views around in the uniconified overall window, they keep scrolling down here in the icon.



You just get all this stuff for free with PostScript. Well, you know, it's not exactly free, but... ha ha!

Now here is, oh yes, right here, this is a stack full of components, of clocks. You can get a property sheet on any of these clocks. The property sheet has three graphics editors, for the face and the two hands. We could just change the color of the hand, or change the total look of anything.



The whole thing is just Legos. The property sheet just plugs the drawing into the clock, and the clock knows how to rotate the hands around the face.

"That's all the same object with different representations?"

Right. One of the data types this system knows is the structured graphics drawing. It plugs it into this property sheet with Alan Turing's head. It just lets me edit the three instance variables.



There's this protocol for property sheets of taking the instance variables, letting you edit them, and then putting them back in when you hit apply. As long as your property sheet plays that protocol, you can plug and play different property sheets, and customize them.

We could make some really crazy looking clocks. Here's a good way to make crazy looking clocks. Woah, oh, let me show you one other thing first.

This clock stack is a warehouse of objects, this is a bunch of examples of objects that I might want to use elsewhere. So I hit the "Install" button, this now installs them into the user interface editor. I'll make myself a new stack. I get a brand new stack. I go into edit mode, and there's this edit menu, and I select "New...", and it's added this menu of new items that I can create! That "Install" button has added this "Neat Clocks" submenu to my edit menu.



So now I can get a "Freaky Clock". And I can get rid of this "Neat Clocks" stack here. And then I can go get other warehouses. Say I wanted a warehouse of Open Look components, then I could just plop them down. New... System... Color Selector. Boing. Now I can select colors from this.



Anyway, now here's another neat way of making patterns.



This is a "Cellular Automata Machine" program, and it's a little klunky on the user interface side, but we've got several pages. This is the introduction. It shows you this real time cellular automata, and you can draw in it with the mouse.

(Check out my collection of stuff about Cellular Automata for more information!)

There are different controls: we can set how fast it goes, start and stop, and there's all these different rules that you can run, that look totally different.

There's Life, then there's Brian's Brain. And you can draw in any of them.

And there are interesting initial configurations, like the heat rule. Heat diffusion is good to start with a circle in the middle. And then you can always draw.

Now the editor lets you fill it with random numbers, and heat diffusion does a good job on that. And you can do some other crazy things that are hard to explain, but ...

The really useful thing that this is good for is this background button labeled "Tile", and we can just go whomp, and just tile the background with the pattern, so it's an interesting screen background generator!



We can also copy the image to the clipboard, and I'll open up a graphics editor, um, where's my Royal Pine, yeah. So here's a graphics editor, and I can paste this image into my graphics editor, and go in there and do neat stuff with it. Clip it to an interesting shape, wee!



I can bring this into my graphics environment, and I can take this structured PostScript graphic, this Royal Pine Car Freshner, and then I can take it back over here to the Cellular Automata Machine, and then paste it in.



Then I can copy that back out. What I like doing is to paste the Royal Pine, oh, first let's cool this down a little bit. You paste the Royal Pine, then you let it go a little bit, then you stop it, and then you paste it again. Woops, oh, my goodness. Here's let's do another rule.



OK, the good one is ld-heat, ok, very subtle, very subtle. Ok, copy that, paste it into here, and then you stop it, and then you paste it again, then you copy it out, and you go here and paste it into the graphics editor, and you have this nice air freshner with an aura!



So who knows what people may decide to do with this kind of stuff. But once you can plug things into each other very easily, and have ubiquituous graphics, it becomes very interesting. Now I could go and use this car freshner, I could copy it onto my clipboard, and go to my new stack, and paste it in, and now it's a button, so now I can make it do things when I click on it.



Oh, oh, oh, oh! Here's a useful little program. When I was working at Sun, my manager came and said, "I need to know you happyness index, a number from one to ten. It doesn't matter how you come up with your happyness, but you have to remember the algorithm you use, so that you can give me the same happyness index later, and we can track your happyness." So what we did, we made "Happy Tool".



This is a HyperLook version of HappyTool. It's going to be a really great thing, once we get this on the network with the biorhythm daemon and birthday dragon and everything else integrated. Basically, you can dial how happy you are, and then, once you've got that, you can click on the face, and it puts it into your clipboard, and you can paste it into the graphics editor.



So now you can paste these into your letters to mom, or whatever, or even, you know, paste them into the Cellular Automata Machine!

You can actually get some really good effects by pasting happy faces into the Cellular Automata Machine. Yeah, let's do a monster. Yeah, ok. I have found the face of Barney in here.



Ok, let's get a good one here.



Let's do a little more symetrical rule here, then paste away. Ok, a little more steam. Oh, ok, here we go, yeah, ok. Aaah.



Yeah, ok, symetry, that's where it's at. Aaauugh! Yeah, try it the other direction.



"What happens if you put Turing's face in there?"

Oh, Turing's face! Where did I put that? It's over here.



You can hit "Props". Just copy that out.



Bring him to the top. And paste!



Aaah! It melted.



Oh wait, let's try it this way. Woah. Oh, oh, and there are other rules that do different things. Let's try pasting Turing's face here.



Oh yeah. Or the big happy face. Woops! Well that slagged. Oh yeah!

Video Tape of Toronto Usenix Address
Video Tape of X11 SimCity Demo



Note: the first port I did was for NeWS, using Sun's object oriented PostScript dialect to write and script the user interface, using HyperLook. Here is an article about it. 
After I shipped that, I started developing the X11 version using TCL/Tk, and made it support multiple players. 
Quite a long time after that, I talked EA into making SimCity open source and donating it to the OLPC project.
I peformed the work to clean up the code and bring it up to EA's requirements to pass their rigorous QA process, in order to be released under the name "SimCity" for the OLPC (and other purposes) under GPL-v3. EA reserved the rights to the trademark SimCity but allows derivitives of the code to be distributed under other names, like "Micropolis", Will Wright's original name for the game. That version released was original X11/TCL/Tk version I developed and distributed over the internet as a free playable unlockable demo, as a commercial product for DUX software, a very early instance of selling downloadable games over the internet, especially gams for unix. You could play for a few minutes, then it would melt your city with a cellular automata, so you had to start again. Trying to save would melt your city instantly. You could call an 800 number and tell them your credit card number over the phone plus your serial number, to get a key that would instantly unlock the game! We sold both node locked and network floating licenses (slightly more expensive),  for both single player and multi player (also slightly more expensive), so you could unlock whatever features you wanted for different prices. So I was actually applying cellular automata to digital rights management, albeit using their destructive qualities to meanly spoil the fun of users who hadn't paid.

SimCity, Cellular Automata, and Happy Tool for HyperLook (nee HyperNeWS (nee GoodNeWS))
HyperLook was like HyperCard for NeWS, with PostScript graphics and scripting plus networking. Here are three unique and wacky examples that plug together to show what HyperNeWS was all about, and where we could go in the future!

SimCity had luxurious mayoral “Screw Up Windows”, multiple animated views with “zoom rockers”, Open Look “pin up” menus, and pop up “pie menus”.
[Note: this is an early draft in progress! Please come again soon.]
Introduction
HyperLook is a HyperCard-inspired graphical user interface development environment from the Turing Institute, but reinvented with networking, and programmed and rendered in PostScript code and graphics.


The Clock Editor let you edit the clock’s face, hour hand and minute hand in three different graphics editors.
It ran on Sun Microsystem’s NeWS (Network extensible Window System) on SunOS 4, and on OpenWindow X11/NeWS on Solaris 2.2.

The Turing Institute originally released a system called “GoodNews” for free in early 1989. Later they released an even better series of free versions named “HyperNeWS”.

I later joined the team in 1992 to help develop HyperNeWS into a commercial product called “HyperLook” for Sun’s OpenWindow X11/NeWS server, supporting The NeWS Toolkit and Open Look components, with multimedia features including shared memory image views and a sound mixer server. At the same time, I also developed a version of Maxis’s game SimCity for HyperLook.


The HyperLook Team: Arthur van Hoff, Dug Scouler, and Don Hopkins.
HyperLook was so far ahead of its time that there still isn’t anything quite like it today. But HyperCard itself has inspired many other systems like Scratch, Snap! and Lively Kernel, which go much further than HyperLook ever did in many ways, using SmallTalk or JavaScript instead of HyperTalk or PostScript.

This article is about how HyperLook was inspired by HyperCard but also unique, and how complex games like SimCity, high performance mathematical simulations like the Cellular Automata engine, and simple creative tools and toys like Happy Tool can artistically dovetail together, and pivot around structured PostScript graphics, data and code, to empower creative users to powerfully and pleasurably compose their own extremely personalized custom interfaces.


The Hands-On Demonstration stack had snapshots of other demo stacks, that opened when clicked.
Structured PostScript graphics, data and code are the axis around which everything rotates.

Using SimCity, the Cellular Automata engine, Happy Tool, and the HyperLook environment itself as examples, I’ll show how HyperLook combines important and powerfully synergistic techniques like networking, message passing, delegation, prototypes, object oriented programming, direct manipulation, interface editing, property sheets and controls.

What’s So Good About NeWS?

The NeWS window system was developed for Poets,
by James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal at Sun Microsystem.
It’s Not The X-Windows Disaster!

One wonderful thing about NeWS that it isn’t X-Windows.

Ok, cheap shot. X-Windows is an easy target (X marks the spot! Even your dog won’t like it! The World’s First Fully Modular Software Disaster! I’ve got a million of ‘em.), so that’s not a strong argument.

But anyway, NeWS had its own software disaster, thank you. But OpenWindow X11/NeWS is another story for later on…

“The X-Windows Disaster” Totally Biased Commentary on NeWS:
Sounds like science fiction? An extensible window server was precisely the strategy taken by the NeWS (Network extensible Window System) window system written by James Gosling at Sun.

With such an extensible system, the user interface toolkit becomes an extensible server library of classes that clients download directly into the server (the approach taken by Sun’s TNT Toolkit).


The NeWS Toolkit 3.0 Widget Demos, JED and RasterRap on OpenWindows 3.0
Toolkit objects in different applications share common objects in the server, saving both time and memory, and creating a look-and-feel that is both consistent across applications and customizable.

With NeWS, the window manager itself was implemented inside the server, eliminating network overhead for window manipulation operations — and along with it the race conditions, context switching overhead, and interaction problems that plague X toolkits and window manager.

“Ultimately, NeWS was not economically or politically viable because it the very problems that X was designed to create.” -The X-Windows Disaster

The Three Axis of AJAX, Which NeWS Also Has To Grind!!!

NeWS was architecturally similar to what is now called AJAX, except that NeWS coherently:

…(drum roll)…

1) Used PostScript CODE instead of JavaScript for PROGRAMMING.

2) Used PostScript GRAPHICS instead of DHTML and CSS for RENDERING.

3) Used PostScript DATA instead of XML and JSON for DATA REPRESENTATION.

The Axis of Eval: Code, Graphics, and Data
We will return to these three important dimensions of Code, Graphics, and Data as a recurring theme throughout this article. But which way to go from here?

Alan Kay on NeWS:

“I thought NeWS was ‘the right way to go’ (except it missed the live system underneath). It was also very early in commercial personal computing to be able to do a UI using Postscript, so it was impressive that the implementation worked at all.” -Alan Kay

PSIBER Space: What Was Visually Programming NeWS Like?
On top of those three dimensions, we must push into FORTH dimension!!! It is know as the dimension of “Stack”, which you can consensually hallucinate and directly manipulate with the PSIBER Space Deck, and macroscopically browse and deeply grok with the PseudoScientific Visualizer.

Cyberspace: A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts…A graphical representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding…

-William Gibson, Neuromancer (1989), pp. 128.


Figure 1 shows objects on the process’s stack displayed in windows with their tabs pinned on the spike.
The PSIBER Space Deck is an interactive visual user interface to a graphical programming environment, the NeWS window system. It lets you display, manipulate, and navigate the data structures, programs, and processes living in the virtual memory space of NeWS. It is useful as a debugging tool, and as a hands on way to learn about programming in PostScript and NeWS.

The Pseudo Scientific Visualizer is the object browser for the other half of your brain, a fish-eye lens for the macroscopic examination of data. It can display arbitrarily large, arbitrarily deep structures, in a fixed amount of space. It shows form, texture, density, depth, fan out, and complexity.

What’s the Big Deal About HyperCard?
“I thought HyperCard was quite brilliant in the end-user problems it solved. (It would have been wonderfully better with a deep dynamic language underneath, but I think part of the success of the design is that they didn’t have all the degrees of freedom to worry about, and were just able to concentrate on their end-user’s direct needs.

“HyperCard is an especially good example of a system that was “finished and smoothed and documented” beautifully. It deserved to be successful. And Apple blew it by not making the design framework the basis of a web browser (as old PARC hands advised in the early 90s …)” -Alan Kay

The Great Big Release of GoodNeWS

Arthur van Hoff, author of GoodNeWS/HyperNeWS/HyperLook.
In early 1989, Arthur van Hoff from the Turing Institute became quite the celebrity in the closely knit NeWS community, by releasing the first version of GoodNeWS (as it was then called).

GoodNeWS was deeply inspired by HyperCard, but took it to another level with the PostScript interpreter, graphics, multithreading, and networking in NeWS. There was nothing else even remotely like it, and it was far better than any of Sun’s own GUI toolkits.

The scoop on GoodNeWS !!!

Danny Pearce with Hyperlook at the Turing Institute (Wikipedia)
Arthur and his colleagues at the Turing Institute had just created a groundbreaking HyperCard-like PostScript-based networked user interface creation tool called GoodNeWS that they wanted to share with the world, so were about to give it away for free on the nascent Internet!

The late but orbital Hugh Daniel’s audacious exuberance and generous efforts to help distribute GoodNeWS in the US were actually well justified, and GoodNeWS would soon be free to download and play with. Once Hugh got excited about something there was no stopping him:

Subject: The scoop on GoodNeWS !!!


Hugh Daniel (April 19, 1962 — June 3, 2013)
I just talked to Doug Scoular at the Truing Institue about the public domaining of GoodNews. He is working on the makefiles for the tape as I write this!

They are going to send two tapes of GoodNeWS to the US, one to UUNET and the other to Grasshopper. I dont know the wording of any licences they have on the tape, but they are trying to put the tape into the full Public Access Domain, if not the Public Domain its self.

The tape should be FTP’able from UUNET and brillig soon after it gets here. I will put a copy on hoptoad for downloading to Sun when ours gets here.

Now, what is GoodNeWS? GoodNeWS was a Macintosh Look/Work alike, with a HyperCard, a MacDraw and other goodies that ran as a uniqe window manager under NeWS. It was the look & feal, but implamented via NeWS insted of QuickDraw.

The new version of GoodNeWS (1.2) has the Look changed to be closer to that of OpenLook. GoodNeWS now also works at the same time a LiteWin, so both window managers can run at the same time. The hypercard like program now handles multiple windows too. We will have to wait to see what all they have really done.

One interesting note about Apple. We asked for a copy of GoodNews back when it had the Macintosh Look & Feal. Turing asked Apple if they would mind, and Apple never responded. The Turing folks decided that they would just change the Look insted of waiting forever to see if Apple was going to yell at them.

In this case at least Apple has gotten what it thinks it wanted. Lets hope it’s not to our detrement.

The Key to SimCity

The Key to SimCity
Through a fortunate turn of events and desperate pleas, I somehow managed to legally obtain the source code for the Mac version of Maxis’s hit game SimCity, and a contract to port it to the Sun workstation.

But I certainly didn’t want to use X11 (although I eventually knuckled under and did), but instead I started porting SimCity to NeWS, using the latest version of HyperNeWS available at the time. Chaim Gingold’s “Play Design” dissertation and his magnum opus book “Building SimCity” tell the story of how that happened:

Open Sourcing SimCity, by Chaim Gingold

Chaim Gingold described Open Sourcing SimCity
in his PhD Dissertation “Play Design”.
In 1991 the computer manufacturer Sun Microsystems, as part of an initiative to address the market for GIS computing (geographic information system), became interested in bringing SimCity into their platform. Sun’s business was rooted in selling Unix workstations, and to that end, would often support the development of applications for specific market verticals. In the summer of 1991, Sun circulated a message to gauge interest in SimCity:


Sun thought SimCity would help sell workstations to the GIS market.
The GIS and Desktop Applications Segments have a window of opportunity to get the #1 selling game “SimCity” ported to Sun. The opportunity also allows us to open up the software so that it can become a front end to GIS applications by including ToolTalk and/or import/export file capability to the standard GIS formats. This and networking will differentiate it from the PC version. The Sun SimCity version will allow Sun to offer a true “desktop” GIS solution as well as a leading entertainment package!

The game is currently being used by many government offices to train their city planners. We have already received high support from ESRI [a developer of commercial GIS products] and URISA [a GIS education and advocacy non-profit] to move the game over and now are seeking Sun field encouragement that will concur with our direction.

Please respond with any comments or customer interest that you think would support the project.

The potential for a serious application, such as GIS, is overblown — it is hard to imagine SimCity enabling Sun to offer a “true ‘desktop’ GIS solution.” The email, however, speaks to the appeal of SimCity as a compelling representation of a city. Not only was it serious enough for GIS, but it was fun, qualities which enabled it to become absorbed into the current of Sun’s marketing agenda.

One person who responded enthusiastically to this proposition was Don Hopkins, a programmer at Sun who first played SimCity in 1989, while studying computer science at the University of Maryland, where it made a deep impression upon him. While a student, Hopkins had worked for the influential user interface researchers Ben Shneiderman and Marc Weiser, where he contributed to the development of pie menus (see Callahan et al. 1988), an unconventional graphical user interface mechanism that would eventually figure prominently in The Sims, on which Hopkins would be a key contributor.

Hopkins began work on the SimCity to Unix conversion while working at Sun, but the project was eventually completed under the aegis of DUX Software. On July 19th 1991, DUX signed a ten year contract to convert and market SimCity on Unix, with Hopkins brought on as a contractor about six months later. Using the Macintosh version of SimCity, Hopkins performed the conversion, rewrote the remaining sections of assembly language to platform neutral C, and changed the platform from Macintosh to X11. Throughout the 1990’s, Hopkins did the programming necessary to convert SimCity to a wide variety of Unix platforms, adding pie menus and multiplayer support (Perkins 1993; Hopkins 2013; Joffe 2015).

Moving to Glasgow for HyperLook and SimCity

The Turing Institute in Glasgow Scotland
I packed up my SparcStation 2 and moved to Glasgow in 1992, to work at the Turing Institute with Arthur, making what was then called HyperNeWS into a product, and porting SimCity to run the Sun Workstation’s NeWS window system with HyperNeWS.


IRN BRU: It’s made in Scotland. From girders.
We then renamed it HyperLook, developed a runtime version suitable for publishing commercial products, wrote documentation and promotions, and released it simultaneously with SimCity, using them both to synergistically promote and demonstrate each other’s value!

Eating Our Own Dog Food, and Loving It
Since we developed HyperLook and SimCity at the same time, that forced us to eat our own dog food, and ensure that HyperLook supported everything you needed to develop real world applications. (Not to imply that SimCity is a real world! ;)


Developing HyperLook and SimCity together forced us to eat our own dog food.

Having such a demanding game as SimCity stress tested HyperLook and forced us to provide features that SimCity required, like high speed raster views and a sound mixer, in a way that benefited the entire environment and all other applications.

Shared Memory Library
The shared memory library we developed for SimCity enabled a client written in C or other languages to read/write the pixels of an image shared in NeWS server, so both the C client and NeWS PostScript can efficiently synchronize, draw into and read back pixels from shared memory. That enables some creative ways of combining raster bitmaps and PostScript graphics, as the Cellular Automata engine demonstrates.


HyperLook had a message oriented network client interface, a shared memory raster animation library, and a real time sound mixer.
We also used the shared memory library with a video capture device, by implementing a C client that connected to the device and dithered the YUV image into an 8 bit NeWS compatible color palette.

Audio Mixer
The audio mixer was essential for SimCity itself, since it required playing multiple simultaneous sounds, that must be mixed in real time. But of course all other HyperLook applications could benefit from being able to play sounds without tripping over each other, too.

The Sun’s /dev/audio device was too low level to support mixing sounds, or even more than one application playing a sound at once. The solution was to develop a sound mixer server, which was simply a HyperLook client who connects to the Sound stack and listens for messages, while mixing any playing sounds in real time.

When any HyperLook applications sends a PlaySound message to the Sound stack, it doesn’t have a handler for it so it’s delegated to the sound mixer client, which handles the message and starts paying the sound. It supports a typical set of messages for controlling the volume per application, globally, or per sound, configuring channels, canceling sounds, etc.

In this way, HyperLook messaging was able to serve the same purpose as D-Bus does today on the Linux desktop.

It’s Burgher Time!
In summary, it was great for HyperLook to have an application like SimCity driving it, and when we released them together, SimCity served as proof of HyperLook’s capabilities, while HyperLook’s capabilities make SimCity even better than it would have been otherwise. Eating our own dog food was a healthy choice!


It’s Burgher Time!
What’s So Interesting about HyperLook?
HyperLook embodies many of the important features of HyperCard, including the ability of users to create their own stacks with direct manipulation editing (but with a non-editable stripped down runtime), property sheets (but user created stacks instead of hardwired native Mac dialogs), a built-in graphics editor (but structured PostScript instead of Pixels), a dynamic scripting language for programming arbitrary behaviors (but PostScript instead of HyperTalk), and delegating messages from “Object => Card => Background => Stack” (but with an additional optional networked “=> Client” tier).


HyperCard uses Stacks and Cards instead of Windows and Layouts.
But it’s different in HyperCard in the way it uses PostScript throughout as the “Three Axis of AJAX”: programming, graphics and data, and it’s more metacircular in that all of its property sheets are HyperLook stacks, which makes deeply customizing the user interface, and adding and configuring new kinds of objects and interaction techniques much easier.

User Can Create and Edit Their Own Stacks of Cards
Like HyperCard, this is the most important difference from traditional apps: at any time (unless you’re using the stripped down runtime with a product like SimCity), you can flip any stack into “edit mode” by a special click or keystroke.


Like HyperCard, HyperLook used the Card/Background/Stack metaphor, but added network clients. Users could create and edit stacks at runtime.
Then you get a bunch more items in the context menu for selecting and creating and editing objects, and you can click and drag to select any object on the card, background or stack, and edit their properties and scripts.

You can copy and paste and duplicate objects around, and they carry their properties and procedures around with them.

Property sheets have one panel to edit their generic properties shared by all objects, and another custom panel that can be tailored specific to each kind of object. Users can even edit the existing property sheets and make their own.


Warehouse stacks like “Warehouse,” “Button Ideas,” “Clocks,” and “Neat Clocks” contain collections of exemplary preconfigured objects, whose names automatically appear under the editor’s “New Object” menu. You can create pre-configured objects from the warehouse anywhere in your own stack.

And you can create your own reusable object prototypes in a warehouse simply by, duplicating or copy/pasting in an existing object, giving it a descriptive name, and customizing its properties or scripts to your heart’s content. Then you can even define a custom property sheet if you need to.

Networking and Message Passing

How HyperLook can solve the world hunger crisis.
Unlike HyperCard, which did not natively support networking, HyperLook clients could connect to the NeWS server, and load and attach to user-editable HyperLook stacks, so they could communicate with each other by sending messages back and forth over the network.

The client, running in a different Unix process that the NeWS server, would register asynchronous handlers for named messages with parameters, and it could send named messages with parameters back to HyperLook objects.

Object => Card => Background => Stack => Client Delegation

HyperLook Messages Delegate From
Object => Card => Background => Stack => Client
Both HyperCard and HyperLook use delegation: When you click on a Button, it first sends a “Click” message to the Button itself. If the Button doesn’t know how to handle it, the event bubbles on to to the Card that contains the Button. If the Card doesn’t know how to handle it, the event then bubbles up to the Background that contains the Card. If the background doesn’t know how to handle it, the event bubbles up to the Stack itself. Finally, if the Stack doesn’t know how to handle it, the events and its parameters get sent over the network to the client, who has the last chance at handling it.

All objects in HyperLook have names, unique within their container, used to address them by path.

When an HyperLook object (or client) receives a message, it includes the message name, the name of the object to whom it was originally sent (like the Button, so the receiver knows where to send any reply), the name of the object who received it (which could be different due to delegation), and a list of parameters. The client can at any time send messages with parameters back to any HyperCard Stack, Background, Card or Object by a path of names.

HyperLook Client Libraries

The Turing Institute held the First International Robot Olympics in September 1990.
HyperLook stacks could send messages to clients over a network connection, and the clients could call native C libraries, Prolog or Lisp programs, image and signal processing algorithms, games like SimCity, simulations like cellular automata, tools like sound mixers, and they could control real world hardware like video capture devices and robots through device drivers.

There was also a shared memory raster animation library (so clients could efficiently draw into image pixels, and NeWS could display multiple scaled views of those images on the screen with PostScript), and a sound mixer (so SimCity and other HyperLook clients could share the audio device, and make overlapping sounds which would be mixed in real time).

Structured PostScript Graphics Editor Component
HyperCard had a wonderful built-in image editor, but it was black and white pixel based (although there were extensions to handle color pixels).


HyperLook had a wonderful structured PostScript graphics editor component.
HyperLook, on the other hand, is completely PostScript based, but PostScript graphics do include pixel based images, which can be scaled, rotated, clipped and transformed in various ways. HyperLook also supports embedding Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files in drawings, and exporting drawings as EPS to be printed or embedded in other documents.

HyperLook had a nice simple built-in structured PostScript graphics editor component, which it used in its own property sheet stacks for editing the graphical properties of any objects, like the shape and background of a stack, or the images of a switch.

HyperLook made it extremely easy (and fun) to set the stack’s shape and appearance to anything you desired!

For example, I quickly was able to whip up a Lava Lamp shaped stack that rendered a live clipped animated view of a psychedelic cellular automata that melted people’s faces.

It’s the PostScript, Dammit!
There are many advantages to using the same language for graphics, scripting, and data. PostScript data consists of arrays, dictionaries, strings, numbers, booleans and null — virtually identical to JSON or Lisp S-expressions.

PostScript’s not just for drawing. PostScript data is great for representing persistent objects, structured graphics, messages, program code, data structures, and everything else that JSON is now used for. PostScript code is homoiconic, in that PostScript code is simply normal PostScript data (a powerful property that JavaScript does not share with PostScript, but Lisp does).


Button Ideas Warehouse With Cool Custom Buttons and Switches To Clone
You get to use the same language to draw all parts of the user interface, as you use to handle events and react to button presses and menu selections and network connections, as you use to read and write objects to the disk or the network.

Customizable buttons and switches flip between different drawings when you click them. You could point at any graphical object and press the “Props” key to bring up a property sheet to edit its properties and graphics, or edit its script to understand and change its behavior.

The ability of the user to easily open up any part of the system and look inside to see how it works, then copy and change it and use it for their own purposes, is extremely important.

Ubiquitous Structured PostScript Drawings
HyperLook’s structured PostScript graphics including stroking and filling paths, rendering text and images, embedding EPS files, grouping, transformation, and clipping. They were represented by big trees of PostScript data.


The Hands-On Demonstration stack had snapshots of other demo stacks, that opened when clicked.
One cool technique that NeWS supported was “PostScript Capture” for snapshotting the results of procedurally drawing PostScript graphics as a flat sequence of drawing commands without any computation (like a PDF file). That’s known as “distilling” PostScript, or “partial evaluation”, and is how Acrobat Distiller creates safe dumb and happy PDF files from dangerous artificially intelligent Turing-complete PostScript documents.

HyperLook stacks had a “Copy as Drawing” menu items that could use PostScript Capture for procedural drawing like Happy Tool, but it created transformed groups that you could deconstruct in the editor for capturing the contents of stacks and objects. So the graphics of a window snapshot maintained their structure as much as possible. It made for very pretty printed documentation!


The Clipboard stack showed whatever was on the clipboard, like an object ,a drawing, an image, or text.
Structured PostScript graphics were ubiquitous throughout HyperLook, and could be copied and pasted on the clipboard, edited by the user, read and written to files and the network, and were used to define how everything looked (while PostScript code was used to define how everything behaved).

Here is a structured PostScript snapshot of the Clipboard stack showing the clipboard containing a structured PostScript snapshot of a graphics editor stack editing a picture of a robot arm holding a structured PostScript snapshot of a demo browser stack, containing a bunch of structured PostScript snapshots of other demo stacks to play with! You can paste it into the editor and ungroup and edit it all the way down!

Object Oriented PostScript Programming
You could edit the behavior of any object with the PostScript script editor. By defining custom message handlers, methods and properties on objects, you could handle interactions locally without sending unnecessary messages to the client over the network. That maximizes interactive responsiveness while minimizing network traffic, just like modern “AJAX”.



HyperLook objects could be customized with object oriented scripts written in PostScrip, and also send, respond and delegate to messages.
HyperLook is completely object oriented, using a system that’s similar to SmallTalk, using the PostScript dictionary stack. Objects could have their own unique scripts attached, which could be edited at runtime and cloned into other objects. The DocBrowser let you browse the class hierarchy and read the documentation, as well as printing documentation for the class and subclasses.



Customizable Property Sheets
Since property sheets of objects were just stacks themselves, you can customize existing ones, and create your own.


HyperLook warehouse stacks contained pre-configured
object prototypes with scripted behaviors,
that you could clone into your own stacks.
You can create your own custom stacks and objects by copying and editing existing ones. When you add our own custom object to a warehouse, you might want to customize its property sheet by copying an existing one and customizing it for your new object (by adding a few controls for new properties, perhaps).

You can make any stack into a warehouse, so each of its pages (which can have descriptive titles) appeared in edit mode on the “New Object” menu, as a submenu containing all the objects in that page. m That makes it easy to create instances in the current stack you’re editing.


HyperLook used its own stacks as property sheets to edit its own objects.
Creating custom property sheets wasn’t super easy — you had to know what you were doing to name the controls properly so they magically accessed the instance variables, get and set and convert back and forth between property types and widget value types (like the drawing editor edited drawings) when you hit “apply”.

By using stacks as property sheets, HyperLook was more meta-circular than HyperCard, whose property sheets were hardwired MacOS dialogs, not HyperCard stacks.


Sun canceled NeWS right after we released HyperLook and SimCity.
This made it possible to create different tiers of property sheets for casual and advanced users, or for users to customize any property sheet themselves! (Not that the product lasted long enough to do that — Sun canceled NeWS right after we released HyperLook and SimCity, so it was a swan song.)

Property sheets for each type also had an LRU menu of all recently edited objects of that type, so you could easily flip back and forth between them really quickly, a common thing to do.

Practical Example: Customizable Clock Editor

The Clock Editor let you edit the clock’s face, hour hand and minute hand in three different graphics editors.
A great example of an object with a custom property sheet is the user configurable clock with three persistent graphical properties: face, minuteHand and hourHand, and whose custom Clock Editor property sheet had three graphics editors for the face, minute and hour hand (NeWS was too slow to animate a second hand *blush*). All this was easily created by copying and pasting and configuring objects in the editor!

There was a warehouse stack of example clocks, which would appear on the editor’s “New Object” menu, so you could easily plop down custom clocks in any other stack.



The NeatClocks stack contained pre-configured prototypes of several gaudy but live clocks.
Nutty Example: Customizable Window Manager
The entire window manager (resize corners, hamburger menus, title bars, paging controls, etc) was deconstructed and available in customizable styles from the warehouse thusly!


Window management components like resize corners were just customizable components like everything.
But why, you might ask, would anyone in their right mind ever want to customize the window manager at such a fine level of granularity???!!!

Well one reason is that SimCity demanded an extremely luxurious set of elegantly beveled matching mayoral quality resize corners and edges, securely fastened to the screen with high quality zirconium encrusted screws (patented “Screw Up Windows” [TM]), defined by eight personally commissioned custom PostScript engineering drawings that would effortlessly stretch with the window size.

[WARNING: NSFW]
Disastrous Example: SimCity
Here’s what SimCity looks like in the middle of a horrible disaster, just before a full stadium of innocent people of diverse and fully saturated ethnicities are about to be brutally and senselessly killed by a big dumb orange Trump-like monster of ambiguous Asian origin, with all SimCity’s windows opened up, Open Look menus pinned up, and pie menus popped up.


SimCity had luxurious mayoral “Screw Up Windows”, multiple animated views with “zoom rockers”, Open Look “pin up” menus, and pop up “pie menus”.
HyperLook Runtime
HyperLook supported a “runtime” version that was slimmed down and compressed, source code stripped and obfuscated as binary, with the stack editor removed (it was also just a component you plug into the stack, which could be replaced with a different editor).


This is what happens when hooligan users vandalize the interface in edit mode.
But with the HyperLook editor installed, you could even edit and deconstruct SimCity while it was running!

You could edit the menus, script your own buttons and pie menus that sent messages to the simulation to help you play or cheat, and copy and paste live SimCity views into your own stacks!

That sure made development fun and easy, but I sure didn’t want to support casual users doing that! That’s why we needed a runtime system.

I shipped SimCity for NeWS as a free demo that you could FTP over the internet, buy over the phone with a credit card, and unlock the full featured game. It included the HyperLook runtime, so users couldn’t actually edit its user interface unless they had the full HyperLook editor.

The stripped-down obfuscated runtime made it possible to develop full commercial products like SimCity with HyperLook. And SimCity served as a promotion and practical example of the capabilities of HyperLook, and the other way around, too.


Honk if you love PostScript!
The HyperLook runtime included some cool demos and an extremely useful general purpose PostScript graphics editor, which was unparalleled on the Sun workstation at the time.

The graphics editor was useful in its own right, but also added value to SimCity. Users could copy pictures of their cities from SimCity to the clipboard, and edit, decorate, annotate and clip them in the graphics editor, and then print them at high resolution on PostScript printers.

A lot of people downloaded SimCity and HyperLook just to use the free HyperLook graphics editor, let alone playing a few minutes of SimCity for free before the city melted.

At the time, there was no way at the time to securely send credit card numbers over the Internet, so we took orders by phone. As long as you called during business hours, you could purchase a license and unlock SimCity within minutes.

Positive Example: Happy Tool
I made a simple “Happy Tool” demo that had a slider to configure how happy you were. You easily adjust your happiness with the Happy stack slider, then click on the face to copy it to the clipboard.


The Happy stack had a slider to adjust your happiness.
To support users with advanced cases of happiness, it had a custom property sheet to edit the fill, stroke and eye color as well as the happiness, and preview the result before applying in a small happy face.

It would draw a big happy or sad face with any colors, and you could click on it to copy it to the clipboard as a drawing.

Then you could use it anywhere: paste it into another drawing, use it as a button or a clock face, make a Unhappy Emo’s Day card, or paste it into a cellular automata machine to see how it melts and disintegrates.


The Happy object’s property sheet has advanced customization controls to fine tune your mood.
The custom object property sheet of the happy face has more advanced controls (both standard shared object controls like stroke and fill color, and a custom stack for custom controls).

You can point at the preview happy face and press the “Help” key to pop up a dynamic help stack on the preview happy face, and it will tell you what you can do, and describe its happiness as text, showing a magnifying glass observing the component.

Inscrutable Example: Cellular Automata Machine

HyperLook Cellular Automata Machine with Lava Lamp
I developed a cool interactive Cellular Automata Machine interface in HyperLook that let you draw directly into the live cells, copy and paste drawings into the cells, and copy the cells out onto the clipboard and into the drawing editor or other HyperLook apps.

You could melt anything you wanted, like an air freshener from a car’s rear view mirror, a sad face from Happy Tool, or Alan Turing’s head from a clock face, then use it for any purpose you can imagine, like a clock face, a button, a Happy Mother’s Day card, or as a screen background.










Having way too much fun with drawings and cellular automata in HyperLook, at the Exploratorium.
This shows pasting a hippie face (John Gilmore) into the Cellular Automata Machine, and a bunch of sample cell snapshots of various rules, copied into the graphics editor! The cellular automata, like SimCity, used the shared memory library to animate the cells efficiently with a client written in C, so it runs quite fast and you can draw on it in real time!


The Cellular Automata Machine let you draw into the cells, paste structured PostScript drawings into the cells, and copy the cells out as images.
Check out the Lava Lamp shaped stack with a clipped cellular automata machine view in it!

I’ve rewritten the CAM6 engine in JavaScript, by the way! Although its user interface is quite mysterious and hard to use. But I’d like to solve that problem by integrating it with Snap! and Lively Kernel, the same way I integrated it with HyperLook, but much better (and faster)!

All Together Now: Exploratorium HyperLook Demo
[TODO: HyperLook Demo video transcript]

The End of NeWS and Beginning of the Diaspora

SGI and Netscape weren’t the only companies in Silicon Valley with Really Bad Attitude.

X11/NeWS collides with SunSoft.
Over many years of development, GoodNeWS was first released for NeWS, then HyperNeWS was released, then finally we released HyperLook with SimCity, just in time for Sun to cancel NeWS.


Arthur van Hoff
PdB
[TODO: Describe PdB, the object oriented C=>PostScript compiler Arthur wrote and used to define some of the classes in HyperLook.]

Distributed Objects Everywhere
[TODO: Describe the Distributed Objects Everywhere (DOE) stock trading game that Sun demonstrated at Object World, which Arthur and his team rapidly and ironically implemented in NeWS after it was officially canceled, in order to deliver a working networked multi player game in time for the show. The Distributed Objects of the Future, using the Network extensible Window System of the past!]

Java
Arthur later went to work with James Gosling on Java, writing the Java compiler in Java, the AWT toolkit, working on the HotJava web browser.

Marimba Castanet and Bongo
Eventually Arthur left Sun to found Marimba, where he developed the widely used Castanet push distribution technology, and the under-appreciated Bongo user interface editing tool: a HypeLook-like user interface editor written in Java, that solved the runtime scripting extension problem by actually calling the Java compiler to dynamically compile and link Java scripts.

Nobody else had ever done anything remotely like Bongo before in Java. Dynamic scripting with Java was unheard of at the time, but since he had written the compiler, he knew the API and how the plumbing worked, so had no qualms about calling the Java compiler at runtime every time you hit the “Apply” button of a script editor.


Danny Goodman’s “Official Marimba Guide to Bongo”
Danny Goodman, the author of the definitive HyperCard book, “The Complete HyperCard Handbook”, went on to write the “Official Marimba Guide to Bongo”, a great book about Bongo, described as the “reincarnation of HyperCard on the Internet”.

[TODO: Write about Bongo’s relationship to HyperCard, HyperLook and Java.]

Java applets are everywhere on Web pages these days, but if you’ve made the move to Java from a contemporary programming environment you’ve probably been dismayed by its relative immaturity. The Official Marimba Guide to Bongo covers Marimba’s Bongo environment, which is designed to allow rapid development of Java user interfaces. The book shows you how to use the large library of graphics “widgets” supplied with Bongo, how to wire them together with simple scripting, and how to integrate other Java applets. It also explains how Bongo can be used to build channels for Marimba’s Castanet system. -Amazon.com Review

Java users should be rejoicing at the promise of programming aid Bongo, which is is the reincarnation of HyperCard on the Internet. It is fitting that the first major book about Bongo comes from Goodman, the author of the definitive HyperCard book of days gone by (The Complete HyperCard Handbook, Random, 1994). His background is as a journalist, not a technologist, and readers will make good use of this first-rate introduction. This book will circulate. -Library Journal Review

Excellent. Now let's write an Inspirations section that has sections to discuss Stone Librand, Brett Victor, Seymour Papert, Alan Kay, Ben Shneiderman, Don Hopkins, and Constructionist Education, the OLPC mission and EA's donation of SimCity, etc. 
The main file to study i notes.txt, and also I have includes a bunch of other historic notes. Now this article is about how we can procede from where we are now, with a WebAssembly / WebGL / HTML / CSS / Canvas / SVG / networked version of Micropolis that runs in the browser, and supports these cool data visualization, visual programming, constructionist education, cooperative multi player, OLPC inspired, and also integrating LLMs via MCP so they can assist human players and play themselves, taking on the roles of the "SimCity Advisors" in SimCity 2000 for example, or even editing the map intelligently in reponse to analyzing the city. @notes
