<p>Chaim Gingold’s comprehensive book explores the history, design, and development of SimCity. An important chapter in this history is the transition from proprietary software to open source.</p>

<h2 id="the-open-source-journey">The Open Source Journey</h2>

<p>In 2008, Electronic Arts collaborated with Don Hopkins and the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project to release the SimCity source code as “Micropolis” under the GPL license. This historic release made the classic city simulation available for study, modification, and education worldwide.</p>

<p>The open-sourcing operates under two important licenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-gpl-license-notice">GPL License with EA’s additional terms</a> - protecting EA’s SimCity trademark while allowing the code to be freely used</li>
  <li>The <a href="/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-public-name-license">Micropolis Public Name License</a> - governing the use of the “Micropolis” name itself</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding these licenses is essential for anyone working with the Micropolis codebase or studying its implementation.</p>
