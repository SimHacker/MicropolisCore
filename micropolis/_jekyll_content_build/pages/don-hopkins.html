<p>Don Hopkins played a pivotal role in bringing SimCity to the open-source community. After working on porting SimCity to various Unix platforms in the early 1990s, he later collaborated with Electronic Arts and the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project to release the SimCity source code as “Micropolis” under the GPL license.</p>

<p>This historic release in 2008 made the classic city simulation available for study, modification, and education worldwide. The project operates under two important licenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-gpl-license-notice">GPL License with EA’s additional terms</a> - protecting EA’s SimCity trademark while allowing the code to be freely used</li>
  <li>The <a href="/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-public-name-license">Micropolis Public Name License</a> - governing the use of the “Micropolis” name itself</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collaboration-with-will-wright-on-the-sims">Collaboration with Will Wright on The Sims</h2>

<p>Don Hopkins joined Maxis in 1997 to work with <a href="/pages/about/will-wright">Will Wright</a> on The Sims, which was released in 2000 after several years of development. During this collaboration, Don contributed to the object-centric architecture of The Sims, where objects themselves contained the behaviors rather than the characters. This innovative approach made the game highly extensible and helped set the foundation for the game’s enormous success.</p>

<p>Don’s work on The Sims built upon his experience with user interface design and object-oriented programming, bringing to life Will Wright’s vision of a highly interactive and modular simulation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What’s cool is that the behavior is entirely distributed in the environment. So a person’s in a room, they have certain motivations, needs, they might be hungry, sleepy, lonely, angry. They scan the room for people and objects, and the objects are all kind of advertising: ‘If you’re angry, pick up me and throw me!’, ‘If you’re hungry, eat me!’” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#from-simcity-to-the-sims">Will Wright</a> on The Sims’ architecture</p>

<h2 id="contributions-and-innovations">Contributions and Innovations</h2>

<p>Don’s contributions to computing extend beyond Micropolis:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pie Menus</strong> - Pioneered the development of radial menus that combine efficiency with ease of use</li>
  <li><strong>TCL/Tk Integration</strong> - Enhanced SimCity with an extensible scripting interface</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface Innovation</strong> - Consistently pushed for more intuitive, direct manipulation interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="current-work">Current Work</h2>

<p>Don continues to work on modernizing Micropolis for current platforms, most recently developing a WebAssembly version with SvelteKit to bring the simulation to modern web browsers.</p>
