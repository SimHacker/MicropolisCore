<h2 id="micropolis-public-name-license">Micropolis Public Name License</h2>

<p>Version 1, October 1st, 2024. Copyright (C) 2024 Micropolis GmbH.</p>

<p>The name/term “MICROPOLIS” is a registered trademark owned by and
exclusively licensed to Micropolis GmbH (Micropolis Corporation, the
“licensor”). It is here (upstream) licensed to the authors/publishers of
the “Micropolis” city simulation game and its source code (the project or
“licensee(s)”).</p>

<p>Your use of the GPL’ed source code under the name “MICROPOLIS” makes you a
subsequent (downstream) licensee of the trademarked term “Micropolis” and
binds you to the same terms as the original upstream authors/publishers
of the project. These terms are:</p>

<p>1. Give proper attribution.  Copying, forking and or using the source code
of the city simulation game under the name “Micropolis” requires you to
include a trademark attribution on the main source code “welcome” page or
on an obverse title page and in “credits” or wherever you acknowledge
other trademarks and copyrights. This attribution requirement also
applies when you use the original name in variation, with suffixes,
prefixes or addenda (e.g., “MicropolisX”, “Ymicropolis” or “Micropolis
Z”). Attribution is also required when the trademark is used in works
where the Micropolis project is covered, for example in blogs, online
texts, scientific works etc.</p>

<p>A preferred attribution would be: “Micropolis is a registered trademark
of Micropolis Corporation (Micropolis GmbH) and is licensed here as a
courtesy of the owner under the Micropolis Public Name License.”
Where possible, activate this attribution with a link to
https://www.micropolis.com and optionally to the license text.</p>

<p>Appropriately propagating the source code of the game requires the
licensee to keep intact all notices stating that this agreement is in
effect and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the code.</p>

<p>2. Acknowledge that the name “MICROPOLIS” is a commercial registered
trademark.  While the use of the bare source code is governed by GPL,
the name of the open source project is a trademark owned by a single
company within the community and the owner grants a revocable license
for the name “MICROPOLIS” to you, the user, for non-commercial use in
relation with the source code and game.</p>

<p>This fact doesn’t restrict software freedom or what you can do with
the open source code. It only limits the use of the brand identifier.
This is in order to enable co-existence under this name, separating the
commercial realm from a free and open source city building game community
and its activities.</p>

<p>3. Do not use the name “MICROPOLIS” in a way that creates confusion
among consumers.  Use of the name must remain closely related to the
source code of the game. Its use must not disparage the licensor in
its projects, e.g. through untruthful advertising, false or misleading
promotional materials, etc. Do not use “MICROPOLIS” more prominently
than your own company, product or service name. Do not use “MICROPOLIS”
on posters, brochures, signs, websites, or other marketing materials to
promote your events, products or services without written permission from
the licensor. Do not refer to a product or service as being certified by,
associated with or claim endorsement of, for or by the licensor. Do not
attempt to claim or assert any ownership rights in the mark “MICROPOLIS”
and do not attempt to register the term as a trademark, trade name,
domain name, or “doing business as” name, alone or in combination with
your own trademarks or addenda.</p>

<p>Apart from giving credit via the courtesy string wherever possible, the
licensee agrees that use of the mark “MICROPOLIS” is done in a way that
helps to mitigate confusion among consumers between the city simulator
game and the licensor’s products.</p>

<p>4. Usage in publishing.  Do not use the term “MICROPOLIS” on the cover
of a book or magazine without written permission from the licensor. You
may not use the term “MICROPOLIS” in your own domain names, subdomains
or as prominent account name on Internet platforms.  This requirement
also applies when you use the original name in variation, with suffixes,
prefixes or addenda (e.g., “MicropolisX”, “Ymicropolis” or “Micropolis
Z”). You acknowledge that the use of the project’s trademarked term
“MICROPOLIS” in such a way is generally not “nominative fair use.”</p>

<p>5. Trademark dilution bailout.  In order to assess a possible future
trademark dilution, the licensee agrees to cease use of the trademark in
case the open source game project contributes, according to the opinion
in public proceedings or in court, to a loss in distinctiveness of the
licensor’s mark.</p>

<p>6. Dispute resolution and jurisdiction.  Court of jurisdiction is Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. Dispute resolution is favored to be handled through the
European Union’s dispute resolution board.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the immediate effect of this licensing document, a grace
period of 90 days from the date of issuance is granted to all prior
users of the “MICROPOLIS” trademark to achieve compliance with the terms
and conditions herein.</p>

<p>For more details, to request approvals or for explicit permissions,
please contact the licensor, <a href="https://www.micropolis.com/">Micropolis</a>.</p>
