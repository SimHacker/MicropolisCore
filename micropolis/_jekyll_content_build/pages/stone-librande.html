<h2 id="revolutionary-documentation-approach">Revolutionary Documentation Approach</h2>

<p>Stone Librande’s GDC talk on “One-Page Designs” completely transformed how I approach visualizing complex systems. His philosophy is brilliantly simple yet profound: distill an entire complex system onto a single, dense, information-rich diagram that reveals the essential structure and relationships. After watching him present examples from Diablo III, The Simpsons, and Spore, I was sold on this approach forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why create a document with more than one page if most people only read the first page anyway?” — Stone Librande</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes Stone’s method revolutionary is how it fights against the fragmentation that happens in traditional documentation. When documentation gets chopped up into separate wiki pages or buried in massive design bibles, the vital relationships between systems become invisible. His one-page approach makes those connections the star of the show!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The more you can consolidate to a single page, the more people will read it. Break up your docs and they die in a drawer.” — Stone Librande</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="connection-to-simcity-and-related-ideas">Connection to SimCity and Related Ideas</h2>

<p>Stone’s work at Maxis was directly influenced by the need to visualize and communicate the complex systems designed by <a href="/pages/about/will-wright">Will Wright</a> for games like SimCity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the things that we’ve tried pretty hard at, I think we’ve been pretty successful at, is keeping numbers out of the user’s face. So whenever possible, we do these things graphically.” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#influence-on-modern-interface-design">Will Wright</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His diagrams became essential tools for the entire team to understand how different simulation components interacted. This echoes Will Wright’s own sentiment about the user’s mental model being the true product:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When we’re designing a model we’re not necessarily designing a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model in the player’s head.” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games">Will Wright</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reverse-engineering diagrams created by <a href="/pages/about/chaim-gingold">Chaim Gingold</a> for his book “Building SimCity” follow directly in the tradition of Stone’s one-page designs, making SimCity’s intricate architecture accessible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The exhaustively-researched illustrations are brilliant, and shockingly well printed in color–you can read them in depth.” — <a href="/pages/about/chaim-gingold#building-simcity-how-to-put-the-world-in-a-machine">Stewart Brand on Chaim Gingold’s work</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach combines the visual density of Stone’s diagrams with the direct manipulation principles of <a href="/pages/about/ben-shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a> and the explorable explanations concept from <a href="/pages/about/brett-victor">Brett Victor</a>. The result is an interface where players can not only build cities but understand the complex systems that make those cities function.</p>

<p>By applying Stone Librande’s philosophy, we aim to make the underlying mechanics of Micropolis transparent and engaging, transforming it from a black box into a comprehensible system.</p>

<h2 id="visual-language-and-communication">Visual Language and Communication</h2>

<p>What Stone and Will share is an understanding that visual language can communicate complex relationships more effectively than linear text. As Stone pointed out in his GDC talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Diagrams make relationships visible. Words make them invisible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This insight has profound implications for how we document and communicate about complex systems like SimCity. It’s why Chaim Gingold’s reverse engineering diagrams are so powerful—they make visible the relationships that remain hidden in the code.</p>

<h2 id="the-connection-to-chaim-gingolds-work">The Connection to Chaim Gingold’s Work</h2>

<p>Chaim Gingold’s remarkable SimCity reverse engineering diagrams represent a perfect application of Stone’s one-page design philosophy. Each diagram captures an entire subsystem of SimCity’s architecture in a single, information-rich visual presentation.</p>

<p>As Stewart Brand noted about Chaim’s diagrams:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The exhaustively-researched illustrations are brilliant, and shockingly well printed in color–you can read them in depth.” — <a href="/pages/about/chaim-gingold#building-simcity-how-to-put-the-world-in-a-machine">Stewart Brand on Chaim Gingold’s work</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The influence of Stone’s approach on Chaim’s work is unmistakable, creating a lineage of visual communication about complex systems that flows from Will Wright’s original simulation design philosophy through Stone’s documentation methods to Chaim’s reverse engineering visualization and finally to our current work on making SimCity’s systems explorable through interactive diagrams.</p>

<h2 id="applying-one-page-design-to-micropolis">Applying One-Page Design to Micropolis</h2>

<p>In our current WebAssembly implementation of Micropolis, we’re applying Stone’s one-page design principles to the user interface itself. By creating consolidated, information-rich control panels that bring together related functions and visualizations, we’re making the simulation more immediately accessible and manipulable.</p>

<p>This approach combines the visual density of Stone’s diagrams with the direct manipulation principles of <a href="/pages/about/ben-shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a> and the explorable explanations concept from <a href="/pages/about/brett-victor">Brett Victor</a>. The result is an interface where players can not only build cities but understand the complex systems that make those cities function.</p>

<h2 id="influence-and-connections">Influence and Connections</h2>

<p>Stone’s work has influenced many, including those involved in the Micropolis project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="/pages/about/will-wright">Will Wright</a>:</strong> Stone worked closely with Will Wright at Maxis. Wright praised Stone’s ability to distill complexity, noting how his one-page designs aligned with the goal of making systems understandable.
    <blockquote>
      <p>“The documentation approach pioneered by Stone Librande at Maxis—distilling complex systems onto single, information-rich diagrams—feels like a natural extension of Will’s own design sensibility: make the complex graspable without oversimplifying.” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#legacy-and-documentation">Will Wright</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="/pages/about/chaim-gingold">Chaim Gingold</a>:</strong> Gingold’s analysis of SimCity often references the importance of visual diagrams in understanding its architecture, work that Stone pioneered.
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Stone Librande’s diagrams clearly illustrate the complex simulation architecture, aligning with the educational goals of constructionist learning environments.” — Referring to Stone’s GDC 2006 slides mentioned on the <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#legacy-and-documentation">Will Wright page</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Constructionist Education:</strong> Stone’s visual approach strongly supports <a href="/pages/about/constructionist-education">constructionist learning principles</a> by making complex systems visible and thus easier to understand and manipulate.</li>
</ul>
