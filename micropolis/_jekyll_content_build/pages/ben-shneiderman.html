<h3 id="key-milestones-in-hyperties-development">Key Milestones in HyperTIES Development</h3>

<p>Shneiderman’s work on hypertext systems began in the early 1980s, well before the World Wide Web:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1982-1983</strong>: The Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) began developing an early hypertext system on IBM PC computers. Dan Ostroff implemented Shneiderman’s concept of embedded menus, where the text itself served as link markers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1983-1984</strong>: The system was developed as The Interactive Encyclopedia System (TIES).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1986</strong>: The system was renamed to HyperTIES due to trademark conflicts. Shneiderman published the influential paper “Embedded menus: Selecting items in context” in Communications of the ACM (April 1986).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1987</strong>: Commercial licensing with Cognetics Corporation began.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1988</strong>: The HCIL team published “Hypertext on Hypertext” in July 1988 CACM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1989</strong>: Don Hopkins developed the NeWS version of HyperTIES with PostScript, FORTH, and Emacs MockLisp, along with creating the HyperTIES authoring tool using pie menus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-significance-of-hyperties">The Significance of HyperTIES</h3>

<p>HyperTIES represented a breakthrough in hypertext navigation through several innovative features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embedded Menu Links</strong>: Shneiderman invented the concept of having text itself serve as link markers, rather than using typed codes, numbered menus, or separate icons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Link Previews</strong>: Users could click once on a link to see a definition at the bottom of the screen before deciding to follow it with a double-click.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Light Blue Link Highlighting</strong>: Through empirical studies, Shneiderman’s team determined that light blue was the optimal color for highlighting links, balancing visibility with reading comprehension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical Links</strong>: HyperTIES allowed for arbitrarily-shaped regions in images to be designated as targets, with innovative “pop-out” highlighting when users hovered over these regions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, acknowledged being influenced by HyperTIES design, particularly the “Hypertext on Hypertext” project that used HyperTIES for the July 1988 CACM.</p>

<h2 id="pie-menus-an-empirical-innovation">Pie Menus: An Empirical Innovation</h2>

<p>One of Shneiderman’s most influential contributions came through his collaboration with Jack Callahan, Don Hopkins, and Mark Weiser on pie menus—a circular menu design that significantly outperformed traditional linear menus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pie menus are 30 percent faster and have half the error rates of menu bars.” — Ben Shneiderman, Scientific American (1997)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In April 1988, the team presented their groundbreaking paper “An Empirical Comparison of Pie vs. Linear Menus” at CHI’88, demonstrating that pie menus were approximately 15% faster with significantly lower error rates than linear menus.</p>

<p>Their research showed that pie menus outperformed traditional linear menus by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reducing target seek time</li>
  <li>Lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor</li>
  <li>Increasing target size according to Fitts’s Law</li>
  <li>Minimizing drift distance after target selection</li>
</ul>

<p>These pie menus were later implemented in the SimCity interface, serving as a natural implementation of Shneiderman’s direct manipulation philosophy. As <a href="/pages/about/stone-librande">Stone Librande</a> noted, the visual approach made complex operations more immediately accessible than text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Diagrams make relationships visible. Words make them invisible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="high-precision-touchscreen-research">High-Precision Touchscreen Research</h2>

<p>Between 1988 and 1991, Shneiderman and his team conducted pioneering research on touchscreen interfaces, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lift-Off Strategy</strong>: A crucial breakthrough where selection happens when the finger is lifted rather than on initial touch, allowing for more precise selections and error correction</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback during interaction</strong>: Visual feedback during touch to show what will be selected</li>
  <li><strong>Screen stabilization</strong>: Techniques to make cursor position more stable during touch</li>
</ul>

<p>This research was later cited as prior art in legal cases contesting Apple’s “Slide to Unlock” patents for the iPhone, demonstrating the long-lasting impact of Shneiderman’s innovations.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-queries-and-the-dynamic-zone-finder">Dynamic Queries and the Dynamic Zone Finder</h2>

<p>Ben’s work on Dynamic Queries and the Dynamic Home Finder directly inspired the implementation of the Dynamic Zone Finder for SimCity. As Ben described it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dynamic Queries. These animations let you rapidly adjust query parameters and immediately display updated result sets, which makes them very effective when a visual environment like a map, calendar, or schematic diagram is available. The immediate display of results lets users more easily develop intuitions, discover patterns, spot trends, find exceptions, and see anomalies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His famous Dynamic HomeFinder prototype for real estate queries demonstrated how users could adjust parameters like cost and number of bedrooms and instantly see matching homes appear on a map. The empirical study showed it was significantly more effective than traditional database query languages.</p>

<p><img src="/images/diagrams/DynamicHomeFinder.png" alt="Ben Shneiderman's Dynamic HomeFinder prototype" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Users rapidly learn to use the visual feedback to find where their solution is likely to be found.” — Ben Shneiderman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This concept was reimagined for SimCity as the “Frob-O-Matic” (later renamed to the Dynamic Zone Finder), allowing players to filter city zones based on various parameters such as population density, pollution, traffic, land value, crime, and more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s just a much higher bandwidth way to query a database than is conventionally used.” — Don Hopkins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="/pages/about/will-wright">Will Wright</a> observed when he saw this implementation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the things that we’ve tried pretty hard at, I think we’ve been pretty successful at, is keeping numbers out of the user’s face. So whenever possible, we do these things graphically.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This perfectly aligned with Shneiderman’s philosophy of making complex data accessible through direct manipulation rather than abstract representation.</p>

<h2 id="shared-foundations-with-brett-victors-work">Shared Foundations with Brett Victor’s Work</h2>

<p>Shneiderman’s approach shares fundamental principles with <a href="/pages/about/brett-victor#shared-foundations-with-ben-shneidermans-work">Brett Victor’s</a> work on explorable explanations and interactive visualization. Both emphasize:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Continuous visual representation</strong> of objects and actions of interest</li>
  <li><strong>Physical actions</strong> or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax</li>
  <li><strong>Rapid, incremental, reversible operations</strong> whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible</li>
  <li><strong>Immediate feedback</strong> on all actions</li>
</ol>

<p>These shared principles have proven fundamental to creating interfaces that help users develop intuition about complex systems through direct manipulation.</p>

<h2 id="human-centered-computing-philosophy">Human-Centered Computing Philosophy</h2>

<p>What has always impressed me about Ben’s approach is his unwavering focus on putting humans first. As he noted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you treat machines like people, you’re likely to end up treating people like machines.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The old computing was about what computers could do; the new computing is about what users can do. Successful technologies are those that are in harmony with users’ needs. They must support relationships and activities that enrich the users’ experiences.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This philosophy guided his naming of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) at the University of Maryland, deliberately putting “Human” before “Computer” in the name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Enable humans to accomplish tasks that weren’t before possible, instead of trying to enable machines to accomplish tasks people can already do.” — Ben Shneiderman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His emphasis on predictability and control as desirable qualities in interfaces - giving users “the feeling of mastery, competence, and understanding, sense of accomplishment” - mirrors the design philosophy in <a href="/pages/about/will-wright">SimCity</a>, where players develop intuition about complex systems through direct manipulation.</p>

<p>In <a href="/pages/about/constructionist-education">constructionist education</a>, Shneiderman’s principles of direct manipulation and dynamic queries provide a perfect technical foundation for Will Wright’s educational goals. Making urban planning principles visible and manipulable allows players to see direct cause-and-effect relationships through visual interfaces rather than abstract numbers.</p>

<p>Ben’s most recent work continues to emphasize this human-centered approach to AI and computing, as seen in his 2020 paper “Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence: Reliable, Safe &amp; Trustworthy.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Leonardo Da Vinci combined art and science and aesthetics and engineering, that kind of unity is needed once again.” — Ben Shneiderman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Dynamic Zone Finder in SimCity stands as a testament to how Ben’s ideas about direct manipulation and dynamic queries can transform how we interact with complex simulations, making them more accessible, understandable, and enjoyable.</p>
