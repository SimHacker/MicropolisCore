<p>Over the past thirty years, I’ve had the fascinating opportunity to implement SimCity across a remarkable range of platforms and technologies - from NeWS/PostScript in 1992, to X11/TCL/Tk for Unix, then Python/GTK when EA open-sourced it for the One Laptop Per Child project (under the <a href="/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-gpl-license-notice">GPL license with additional terms</a>), later Flash/OpenLaszlo for early web browsers, and now WebAssembly/SvelteKit for modern web standards. Each implementation has been like a different lens revealing new possibilities while preserving the brilliance of Will Wright’s original simulation.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="key-influences-and-inspirations">Key Influences and Inspirations</h2>

<p>Throughout SimCity’s evolution, several key thinkers have profoundly influenced its design, visualization, and educational applications. Each has contributed unique perspectives that shape how we understand and interact with complex systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/pages/about/will-wright">Will Wright</a></strong> - Creator of SimCity and The Sims whose unique approach to game design and simulation has revolutionized how we think about interactive systems and learning through play.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“One of the paradigms we’ve tried to use in designing these simulations is to think of them a little bit more as toys rather than games.” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#separating-simulation-from-game">Will Wright</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/pages/about/chaim-gingold">Chaim Gingold</a></strong> - His reverse engineering diagrams transformed SimCity’s architecture from opaque code into visually comprehensible systems, revealing the elegant design principles at its core.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“This project took over a decade to research and write. The simple answer about the difference between ‘hoping for’ and ‘final’ product encompasses a lot of what makes software and game development interesting.” — <a href="/pages/about/chaim-gingold#chaims-decade-long-research-journey">Chaim Gingold</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/pages/about/ben-shneiderman">Ben Shneiderman</a></strong> - Pioneer of direct manipulation interfaces and dynamic queries, whose work directly influenced the development of pie menus and the Dynamic Zone Finder for SimCity.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Users rapidly learn to use the visual feedback to find where their solution is likely to be found.” — <a href="/pages/about/ben-shneiderman#dynamic-queries-and-the-dynamic-zone-finder">Ben Shneiderman</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/pages/about/brett-victor">Brett Victor</a></strong> - His revolutionary work on explorable explanations and interactive visualization has shaped how we approach making SimCity’s systems visible and manipulable.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Creators need an immediate connection to what they’re creating.” — <a href="/pages/about/brett-victor#revolutionary-approach-to-interface-design">Brett Victor</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/pages/about/stone-librande">Stone Librande</a></strong> - His one-page design philosophy transformed how we visualize and document complex systems, influencing both Chaim’s diagrams and our current interface design.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Why create a document with more than one page if most people only read the first page anyway?” — <a href="/pages/about/stone-librande#revolutionary-documentation-approach">Stone Librande</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/pages/about/constructionist-education/doreen-nelson">Doreen Nelson</a></strong> - Her pioneering work on Design-Based Learning created a critical bridge between physical city-building activities and SimCity’s digital simulation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Design-Based Learning empowers students to become active creators, not just passive consumers of information.” — <a href="/pages/about/constructionist-education/doreen-nelson">Doreen Nelson</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simulation-architecture">Simulation Architecture</h2>

<p>SimCity’s core design represents a masterclass in efficient simulation architecture. By studying the <a href="/pages/reverse-diagrams">Reverse Diagrams</a> (reverse-engineered by Chaim Gingold), we can appreciate the elegant solutions that enable a complex, believable urban simulation on limited hardware.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When we’re designing a model we’re not necessarily designing a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model in the player’s head.” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games">Will Wright</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I ported this architecture to more powerful platforms, I preserved this multi-resolution design rather than “simplifying” it with brute force computation. Good architecture transcends hardware generations.</p>

<p>SimCity’s traffic system is perhaps the most ingenious technical solution in the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Statistical Abstraction</strong> - Each path represents many individual trips, not single vehicles—a fundamental abstraction that enables the entire system</li>
  <li><strong>Randomized Pathfinding</strong> - A simple but effective stack-based randomized approach that creates realistic traffic patterns without requiring A* pathfinding</li>
  <li><strong>Emergent Behavior</strong> - Road network quality naturally emerges from pathfinding success/failure, teaching players good urban design through direct experience</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Modal Transportation</strong> - Different handling of roads vs. rail creates meaningful gameplay choices with distinctive traffic patterns</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I just kind of optimized for game play.” — <a href="/pages/about/will-wright#reverse-over-engineering">Will Wright</a>, when asked which urban planning theory informed SimCity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These diagrams expose the consistent philosophy across all of SimCity’s systems: elegant simplification, efficient data representation, careful orchestration, and emergent complexity from simple rules.</p>
