# Brett Victor and Explorable Explanations

## Revolutionary Approach to Interface Design

Brett Victor's work on creating dynamic, responsive interfaces where users can directly manipulate data and see immediate results has fundamentally transformed how I approach SimCity's visualization systems. His concept of "Explorable Explanations" - interactive documents where readers can play with the assumptions and see how systems behave - perfectly captures what I'm trying to achieve with SimCity's simulation layers.

> "People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it." — Brett Victor

What makes Brett's approach revolutionary is his relentless focus on closing the gap between human thought and computational representation. As he famously argues, "Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating." When I first saw his demonstrations of dynamic, interactive interfaces that respond instantly to manipulation, I recognized exactly what had been missing from our simulation tools.

> "Information software design is the design of context-sensitive information graphics. This is not a spreadsheet, not a database, not even 'information architecture.' It is an artistic discipline, and its creative medium is context-sensitive information graphics." — Brett Victor, "Magic Ink"

## Connection to SimCity and Will Wright's Vision

Brett's philosophy remarkably echoes Will Wright's approach to simulation games. When Will said:

> "When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model in the player's head." — [Will Wright](/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games)

He was expressing a principle that Brett would later formalize in his work on explorable explanations. Both understand that computational models are merely tools to build understanding in human minds.

Brett's essays like "Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction" provide a framework for thinking about how to make complex systems explorable. This aligns perfectly with Will's insight about why people connect so deeply with SimCity:

> "Everybody's taking a linear path through this, and they're basically, most people will attempt to understand things like this with a story. They'll think about 'I did this, then that happened, because of that', and so the story becomes kind of their logical connection, their logical reverse engineering, of the simulation that they're playing inside of." — [Will Wright](/pages/about/will-wright#a-new-paradigm-for-game-design)

## Shared Foundations with Ben Shneiderman's Work

Brett's approach shares fundamental principles with Ben Shneiderman's work on direct manipulation interfaces and dynamic queries. Both emphasize:

1. **Continuous visual representation** of objects and actions of interest
2. **Physical actions** or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax
3. **Rapid, incremental, reversible operations** whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible
4. **Immediate feedback** on all actions

> "Users rapidly learn to use the visual feedback to find where their solution is likely to be found." — [Ben Shneiderman](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman#dynamic-queries-and-the-dynamic-zone-finder)

Brett extends these principles with his emphasis on making the invisible visible—showing users what's happening inside systems they're interacting with.

## Learnable Programming

In Brett's influential essay "Learnable Programming," he articulates principles that closely align with how I'm approaching the visualization of SimCity's internal systems:

> "Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill. Learning about 'for' loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw."

His emphasis on making the flow of data visible, making time visible, and making the state visible informs our approach to revealing SimCity's simulation architecture through interactive diagrams based on Chaim Gingold's reverse engineering.

> "The system must have no hidden state. State should either be eliminated, or represented as explicit objects on the screen. Every action must have a visible effect."

This principle is at the heart of our effort to transform SimCity from a "black box" simulation into an explorable explanation of urban systems—where players can not only see the results of their actions but understand the causal mechanisms that produced those results.

By integrating Brett's principles with Will Wright's simulation design philosophy and Ben Shneiderman's direct manipulation interfaces, we're creating a new kind of explorable urban simulation that fulfills the educational potential that has always been latent in SimCity.

## Influence on SimCity and Micropolis

Victor's ideas have been a major inspiration for my work on visualizing and interacting with the Micropolis simulation. His emphasis on immediate feedback and manipulable representations directly informs the design goals for the current WebAssembly version.

> "When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model in the player's head." — [Will Wright](/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games)

Victor's critique of conventional programming tools resonates with the challenges of understanding complex simulation code. Making the simulation's state and behavior visible and directly manipulable is key to bridging the gap between the code and the player's mental model.

> "Everybody's taking a linear path through this, and they're basically, most people will attempt to understand things like this with a story. They'll think about 'I did this, then that happened, because of that', and so the story becomes kind of their logical connection, their logical reverse engineering, of the simulation that they're playing inside of." — [Will Wright](/pages/about/will-wright#a-new-paradigm-for-game-design)

## Shared Foundations with Ben Shneiderman's Work

Victor's work shares philosophical roots with [Ben Shneiderman](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman)'s principles of direct manipulation and dynamic queries. Both advocate for interfaces that provide:

1.  Continuous visual representation of the objects of interest.
2.  Physical actions or simple button presses instead of complex syntax.
3.  Rapid, incremental, reversible operations.
4.  Immediate visibility of the results of actions.

> "Users rapidly learn to use the visual feedback to find where their solution is likely to be found." — [Ben Shneiderman](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman#dynamic-queries-and-the-dynamic-zone-finder)

By applying these principles, we aim to make Micropolis not just a game, but a tool for thought—an explorable explanation of urban dynamics.
