## Micropolis Public Name License {#micropolis-public-name-license}

Version 1, October 1st, 2024. Copyright (C) 2024 **Micropolis GmbH**.

The name/term "**MICROPOLIS**" is a registered trademark owned by and
exclusively licensed to **Micropolis GmbH** (**Micropolis Corporation**, the
"**licensor**"). It is here (upstream) licensed to the authors/publishers of
the "**Micropolis**" city simulation game and its source code (the project or
"**licensee(s)**").

Your use of the **GPL'ed source code** under the name "**MICROPOLIS**" makes you a
subsequent (downstream) **licensee** of the trademarked term "**Micropolis**" and
binds you to the same terms as the original upstream authors/publishers
of the project. These terms are:

1.  Give proper attribution. Copying, forking and or using the source code
    of the city simulation game under the name "**Micropolis**" requires you to
    include a **trademark attribution** on the main source code "welcome" page or
    on an obverse title page and in "credits" or wherever you acknowledge
    other trademarks and copyrights. This attribution requirement also
    applies when you use the original name in variation, with suffixes,
    prefixes or addenda (e.g., "**MicropolisX**", "**Ymicropolis**" or "**Micropolis**
    **Z**"). Attribution is also required when the trademark is used in works
    where the **Micropolis** project is covered, for example in blogs, online
    texts, scientific works etc.

    A preferred attribution would be: "**Micropolis is a registered trademark**
    **of Micropolis Corporation (Micropolis GmbH) and is licensed here as a**
    **courtesy of the owner under the Micropolis Public Name License.**"
    Where possible, activate this attribution with a link to
    [https://www.micropolis.com](https://www.micropolis.com) and optionally to the license text.

    Appropriately propagating the source code of the game requires the
    **licensee** to keep intact all notices stating that this agreement is in
    effect and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the code.

2.  Acknowledge that the name "**MICROPOLIS**" is a commercial registered
    trademark. While the use of the bare source code is governed by **GPL**,
    the name of the **open source** project is a trademark owned by a single
    company within the community and the owner grants a revocable license
    for the name "**MICROPOLIS**" to you, the user, for non-commercial use in
    relation with the source code and game.

    This fact doesn't restrict **software freedom** or what you can do with
    the **open source code**. It only limits the use of the brand identifier.
    This is in order to enable co-existence under this name, separating the
    commercial realm from a free and **open source city building game community**
    and its activities.

3.  Do not use the name "**MICROPOLIS**" in a way that creates confusion
    among consumers. Use of the name must remain closely related to the
    source code of the game. Its use must not disparage the **licensor** in
    its projects, e.g. through untruthful advertising, false or misleading
    promotional materials, etc. Do not use "**MICROPOLIS**" more prominently
    than your own company, product or service name. Do not use "**MICROPOLIS**"
    on posters, brochures, signs, websites, or other marketing materials to
    promote your events, products or services without written permission from
    the **licensor**. Do not refer to a product or service as being certified by,
    associated with or claim endorsement of, for or by the **licensor**. Do not
    attempt to claim or assert any ownership rights in the mark "**MICROPOLIS**"
    and do not attempt to register the term as a trademark, trade name,
    domain name, or "doing business as" name, alone or in combination with
    your own trademarks or addenda.

    Apart from giving credit via the courtesy string wherever possible, the
    **licensee** agrees that use of the mark "**MICROPOLIS**" is done in a way that
    helps to mitigate confusion among consumers between the city simulator
    game and the **licensor's** products.

4.  Usage in publishing. Do not use the term "**MICROPOLIS**" on the cover
    of a book or magazine without written permission from the **licensor**. You
    may not use the term "**MICROPOLIS**" in your own domain names, subdomains
    or as prominent account name on **Internet platforms**. This requirement
    also applies when you use the original name in variation, with suffixes,
    prefixes or addenda (e.g., "**MicropolisX**", "**Ymicropolis**" or "**Micropolis**
    **Z**"). You acknowledge that the use of the project's trademarked term
    "**MICROPOLIS**" in such a way is generally not "**nominative fair use**."

5.  **Trademark dilution bailout**. In order to assess a possible future
    **trademark dilution**, the **licensee** agrees to cease use of the trademark in
    case the **open source** game project contributes, according to the opinion
    in public proceedings or in court, to a loss in distinctiveness of the
    **licensor's** mark.

6.  Dispute resolution and jurisdiction. Court of jurisdiction is **Amsterdam**, the
    **Netherlands**. Dispute resolution is favored to be handled through the
    **European Union's dispute resolution board**.

Notwithstanding the immediate effect of this licensing document, a grace
period of 90 days from the date of issuance is granted to all prior
users of the "**MICROPOLIS**" trademark to achieve compliance with the terms
and conditions herein.

For more details, to request approvals or for explicit permissions,
please contact the **licensor**, [**Micropolis**](https://www.micropolis.com/).
