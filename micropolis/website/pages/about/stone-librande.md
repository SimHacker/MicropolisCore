## Revolutionary Documentation Approach {#revolutionary-documentation-approach}

**Stone Librande's** influential **GDC** talk on "**One-Page Designs**" completely transformed how I ([**Don Hopkins**](/pages/about/don-hopkins)) approach visualizing complex systems. This perspective was reinforced by my own experience working on design docs and prototypes with [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright)—both at **Maxis/EA** on [**The Sims**](/pages/about/will-wright#from-simcity-to-the-sims) and over decades for his personal think tank **Stupid Fun Club**. Stone, like myself and [**Chaim Gingold**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold), was deeply inspired by Will's philosophy and approach. We all feel fortunate to have benefited from working with Will firsthand and share a desire to pass that knowledge forward.

The core philosophy is brilliantly simple yet profound: distill an entire complex system onto a single, dense, information-rich diagram that reveals the essential structure and relationships. After watching Stone present examples from **Diablo III**, **The Simpsons**, and [**Spore**](/pages/about/will-wright), I was sold on this approach forever.

> "Why create a document with more than one page if most people only read the first page anyway?" — **Stone Librande**

What makes Stone's method revolutionary is how it fights against the fragmentation that happens in traditional documentation. When documentation gets chopped up into separate **wiki pages** or buried in massive **design bibles**, the vital relationships between systems become invisible. His **one-page approach** makes those connections the star of the show! A famous example is [**Will Wright's**](/pages/about/will-wright) one-page design document for [**Spore**](/pages/about/will-wright), which he [leaked to **Wired Magazine**](https://donhopkins.medium.com/the-future-of-content-will-wrights-spore-demo-at-gdc-3-11-2005-568857a2e6e9) a year before the game was announced.

> "The more you can consolidate to a single page, the more people will read it. Break up your docs and they die in a drawer." — **Stone Librande**

> "it highlights the relationships in the system so it lets you as a designer as you start putting these things together and drawing arrows and connecting the lines you're like oh that has that effect on this other thing oh I see it now where like I mentioned the wiki is notorious for chopping up your design and breaking connections between things" — **Stone Librande**

## Connection to SimCity and Related Ideas

Stone's work at **Maxis** was directly influenced by the need to visualize and communicate the complex systems designed by [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright) for games like [**SimCity**](/pages/about/will-wright).

> "One of the things that we've tried pretty hard at, I think we've been pretty successful at, is keeping numbers out of the user's face. So whenever possible, we do these things graphically." — [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright#influence-on-modern-interface-design)

His diagrams became essential tools for the entire team to understand how different simulation components interacted. This echoes [**Will Wright's**](/pages/about/will-wright) own sentiment about the user's [**mental model**](/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games) being the true product:

> "When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing a computer model. Our real end product is the **mental model** in the player's head." — [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games)

The [**reverse-engineering diagrams**](/pages/reverse-diagrams) created by [**Chaim Gingold**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold) for his book "[**Building SimCity**](/pages/building-simcity)" follow directly in the tradition of Stone's **one-page designs**, making **SimCity's** intricate architecture accessible.

> "**Diagrams make relationships visible. Words make them invisible.**" — **Stone Librande**

This approach combines the visual density of Stone's diagrams with the [**direct manipulation**](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman) principles of [**Ben Shneiderman**](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman) and the [**explorable explanations**](/pages/about/brett-victor#revolutionary-approach-to-interface-design) concept from [**Brett Victor**](/pages/about/brett-victor). The result is an interface where players can not only build cities but understand the complex systems that make those cities function.

By applying **Stone Librande's** philosophy, we aim to make the underlying mechanics of [**Micropolis**](/pages/micropolis-license) transparent and engaging, transforming it from a **black box** into a comprehensible system.

## Visual Language and Communication

What Stone and Will share is an understanding that **visual language** can communicate complex relationships more effectively than linear text. This insight has profound implications for how we document and communicate about complex systems like **SimCity**. It's why [**Chaim Gingold's**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold) [**reverse engineering diagrams**](/pages/reverse-diagrams) are so powerful—they make visible the relationships that remain hidden in the code.

## The Connection to Chaim Gingold's Work

[**Chaim Gingold's**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold) remarkable [**SimCity reverse engineering diagrams**](/pages/reverse-diagrams) represent a perfect application of Stone's **one-page design philosophy**. Each diagram captures an entire subsystem of **SimCity's** architecture in a single, information-rich visual presentation. **Chaim himself credits the influence of Stone, [Brett Victor](/pages/about/brett-victor), and [Will Wright](/pages/about/will-wright) in his diagrams and book, a sentiment I wholeheartedly echo.**

As **Stewart Brand** noted about Chaim's diagrams:

> "The exhaustively-researched illustrations are brilliant, and shockingly well printed in color--you can read them in depth." — [**Stewart Brand** on **Chaim Gingold's** work](/pages/about/chaim-gingold#building-simcity-how-to-put-the-world-in-a-machine)

The influence of Stone's approach on Chaim's work is unmistakable, creating a lineage of visual communication about complex systems that flows from [**Will Wright's**](/pages/about/will-wright) original simulation design philosophy through Stone's documentation methods to Chaim's **reverse engineering visualization** and finally to our current work on making **SimCity's** systems explorable through interactive diagrams.

## Applying One-Page Design to Micropolis

In our current [**WebAssembly implementation of Micropolis**](/pages/don-hopkins#current-work), we're applying Stone's **one-page design** principles not just to documentation, but to the user interface itself. By creating consolidated, information-rich control panels that bring together related functions and visualizations, we're making the simulation more immediately accessible and manipulable. This aligns with the overall vision captured in the planned **Micropolis Project One-Page Design**.

This approach combines the visual density of Stone's diagrams with the [**direct manipulation**](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman) principles of [**Ben Shneiderman**](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman) and the [**explorable explanations**](/pages/about/brett-victor#revolutionary-approach-to-interface-design) concept from [**Brett Victor**](/pages/about/brett-victor). The result is an interface where players can not only build cities but understand the complex systems that make those cities function.

Looking forward, we aim to take this much further, directly addressing [**Alan Kay's**](/pages/constructionist-education/alan-kay) critique that **SimCity** can function as a "black box." Inspired by Stone's emphasis on visibility, [**Chaim Gingold's**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold) insightful [**reverse diagrams**](/pages/reverse-diagrams) (which he has graciously permitted us to bring to life), and [**Will Wright's**](/pages/about/will-wright) focus on [**mental models**](/pages/about/will-wright#the-anatomy-of-simulation-games), our goal is radical transparency. We plan to evolve these static diagrams into dynamic, interactive views *into* the running simulation—live browsers, visualizers, editors, and even scripting interfaces using technologies like [**SvelteKit runes**](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes), [**WebGL**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API), and [**Canvas**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). Imagine directly manipulating the [**Map Data Flow**](/pages/reverse-diagrams#map-data-flow) or plugging into the [**Simulation Loop**](/pages/reverse-diagrams#simulation-loop) with visual programming tools like [**Snap!**](https://snap.berkeley.edu/).

This endeavor—making the invisible visible and manipulable—is the next step in realizing the educational and creative potential inherent in these powerful simulation ideas, standing on the shoulders of giants like **Stone Librande**, **Will Wright**, **Chaim Gingold**, **Ben Shneiderman**, **Brett Victor**, and **Alan Kay**.

## Influence and Connections {#influence-and-connections}

Stone's work has influenced many, including those involved in the [**Micropolis**](/pages/micropolis-license) project:

- **[Will Wright](/pages/about/will-wright):** Stone worked closely with [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright) at **Maxis**. Wright praised Stone's ability to distill complexity, noting how his **one-page designs** aligned with the goal of making systems understandable.
    > "The documentation approach pioneered by **Stone Librande** at **Maxis**—distilling complex systems onto single, information-rich diagrams—feels like a natural extension of **Will's** own design sensibility: make the complex graspable without oversimplifying." — [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright#legacy-and-documentation)
    
    > "it really forces you as a designer to do some work in your head [...] you actually have to really understand the problem otherwise you'll never be able to make one of these diagrams to begin with" — **Stone Librande**

- **[Chaim Gingold](/pages/about/chaim-gingold):** Gingold's analysis of **SimCity** in "[**Building SimCity**](/pages/building-simcity)" often references the importance of visual diagrams in understanding its architecture, work that Stone pioneered. The [**reverse diagrams**](/pages/reverse-diagrams) in Chaim's book are a testament to this approach.
    > "**Stone Librande's** diagrams clearly illustrate the complex simulation architecture, aligning with the educational goals of **constructionist** learning environments." — Referring to Stone's **GDC 2006** slides mentioned on the [**Will Wright** page](/pages/about/will-wright#legacy-and-documentation).

- **Systemic Game Designers:** Stone's GDC talk on one-page designs is widely regarded as highly influential in the field.
    > "One of the best game design talks I've ever seen is **Stone Librande's** talk on **one-page designs**." — **mannander**, [Playtank Blog](https://playtank.io/2024/06/12/designing-a-systemic-game/)

- **[Constructionist Education](/pages/constructionist-education):** Stone's visual approach strongly supports [**constructionist learning principles**](/pages/constructionist-education) by making complex systems visible and thus easier to understand and manipulate.
