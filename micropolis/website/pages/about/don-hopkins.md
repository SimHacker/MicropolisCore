---

As a programmer specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction**, I've had the privilege of working on several iterations and ports of [**Will Wright's**](/pages/about/will-wright) groundbreaking **SimCity**, as well as being a core developer on [**The Sims**](/pages/about/will-wright#from-simcity-to-the-sims). My focus has always been on creating fun, expressive user interfaces and empowering user creativity through accessible tools.

This page outlines the major projects involving these simulations that I've been involved with over the decades, each representing a unique "sally" in exploring simulation, interface design, and user creation.

## SimCity/Micropolis/Sims Evolution: My Simulational Sallies {#evolution-sallies}

Here is a chronological overview of the key simulation game projects and versions I contributed to. Each represents a distinct phase in the evolution of the simulation and its interface, building upon previous work and exploring new technologies.

*   **[SimCity for NeWS/HyperLook (1991-1992)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/simcity-news-hyperlook):** Ported SimCity Classic to Sun Microsystems' NeWS (Network-extensible Window System) using the PostScript-based HyperLook user interface environment, with NeWS pie menus and OPEN LOOK widgets.

*   **[SimCity for X11/TCL/Tk (1993)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/simcity-x11-tcltk):** Developed a Unix version using the X Window System and the TCL/Tk scripting language, featuring TCL/Tk pie menus and an extensible UI.

*   **[Multiplayer SimCityNet (1993)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/multiplayer-simcity-net):** Created a networked, cooperative multiplayer version based on the X11/TCL/Tk codebase.

*   **[The Sims (1997-2000)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/the-sims):** Worked on the core Maxis team, contributing to the character animation system, pie menu UI, architectural editing tools, internal development tools (Edith/SimAntics), 3ds Max pipeline, and user empowerment tools. Advocated for same-sex relationship representation. (See dedicated page for details).

*   **[SimCity for OLPC (2007-2008)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/olpc-simcity):** Collaborated with EA and OLPC to open-source the SimCity code under the GPL as Micropolis. Adapted the TCL/Tk version for the XO-1 laptop, adding educational features and programmability.

*   **[Micropolis C++/Python Integration (Ongoing)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/micropolis-cpp-python):** Refactored the original C code into C++, cleaned, commented, and documented it, making it integratable with Python via SWIG.

*   **[Micropolis Linux PyGTK Version (Deprecated)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/micropolis-linux-pygtk):** Developed a desktop version using PyGTK, Cairo, and Pango for rendering, incorporating pie menus.

*   **[Micropolis Online (TurboGears/OpenLaszlo - Deprecated)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/micropolis-online-turbogears-openlaszlo):** Created a web-based client-server version using the C++/Python core with a TurboGears server and an OpenLaszlo/Flash client, also incorporating pie menus of course.

*   **[Micropolis Web (WASM/WebGL/SvelteKit - Current)](/pages/about/don-hopkins/micropolis-web-wasm-webgl-sveltekit):** The current project, porting the C++ core to WebAssembly using Emscripten/embind, building a new UI with TypeScript/SvelteKit, and rendering with WebGL/HTML/Canvas. A key goal is creating interactive versions of Chaim Gingold's diagrams.

## SimCity to Micropolis: The Open Source Sally {#open-source-sally}

I played a pivotal role in bringing **SimCity** to the **open-source** community. After working on porting **SimCity** to various **Unix** platforms (like **SunOS/Solaris**, **IRIX**, **HP-UX**, **NCD**, **Linux**, etc.) in the early 1990s, I later collaborated with **Electronic Arts** and the **One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)** project to release the **SimCity** source code as "[**Micropolis**](/pages/micropolis-license)" under the [**GPL license**](/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-gpl-license-notice).

This historic release in 2008 made the classic city simulation available for study, modification, and education worldwide. The project operates under two important licenses:

- The [**GPL License with EA's additional terms**](/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-gpl-license-notice) - protecting **EA's SimCity trademark** while allowing the code to be freely used

- The [**Micropolis Public Name License**](/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-public-name-license) - governing the use of the "**Micropolis**" name itself

[**Chaim Gingold's**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold) book, "[**Building SimCity**](/pages/building-simcity)", details much of this history and the context surrounding the original game. I provided Chaim with historical source code to analyze for the book, which included the [**reverse diagrams**](/pages/reverse-diagrams) now featured on this site.

## Collaboration with Will Wright on The Sims {#collaboration-the-sims}

I joined **Maxis** in 1997 to work with [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright) on [**The Sims**](/pages/about/don-hopkins/the-sims), which was released in 2000. As part of the core team, I contributed to character animation, UI (including [**pie menus**](/pages/about/ben-shneiderman#pie-menus-an-empirical-innovation) and architectural tools), internal development tools (**Edith/SimAntics**), the **3ds Max** pipeline, and advocating for inclusive relationship representation. A major focus was empowering the player community through user creation tools.

> "What's cool is that the behavior is entirely distributed in the environment... the objects are all kind of advertising..." — [**Will Wright**](/pages/about/will-wright#from-simcity-to-the-sims) on **The Sims'** object-oriented AI

My work aimed to fulfill Will's "hobby model" vision for the game. **[Read more about my contributions to The Sims here.](/pages/about/don-hopkins/the-sims)**

## Current Work {#current-work}

My current efforts span several areas, continuing my focus on interactive simulation, user interface design, and leveraging modern technologies:

### Hypermedia & Networking {#hypermedia-networking}

*   **[HyperTIES](https://donhopkins.medium.com/hyperties-discussions-from-hacker-news-937d156f0330):** Developed the hypermedia browser for this influential system at UMD HCIL, initially prototyping with Sun Forth and C, then implementing the final version using **NeWS**/**PostScript** for display and interaction. Separately developed an integrated **HyperTIES Authoring Tool** within **UniPress Emacs** for NeWS (leveraging my prior work at UniPress). HyperTIES pioneered features like embedded textual/graphical links ([pop-out targets](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17109221)), definition previews, [pie menu](#pie-menus) navigation, and importantly, extensibility via embedded interactive **PostScript applets** (including pie menus, graphical pop-up targets, editors, terminals, animations) – an early implementation of the concept later popularized by **Java Applets**. This work connected several threads: both NeWS and UniPress Emacs were originally designed by **James Gosling** (who I later worked with at Sun on NeWS, and who subsequently developed **Java** with **Arthur van Hoff**, the eventual founder of **Jaunt VR**). This groundbreaking HyperTIES system and its capabilities were demonstrated to **Steve Jobs** (who famously reacted "That sucks! That sucks! Wow, that's neat. That sucks!") and **Bill Joy** (who revealed his surprising Emacs/ITS past) at **Educom** ([HN Discussion with anecdotes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17109221), [Further HN Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29721140)).
