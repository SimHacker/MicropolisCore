## Constructionism: Learning by Making

**Constructionism** is an educational philosophy developed by [**Seymour Papert**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/seymour-papert) at the **MIT Media Lab**, building upon the work of [**Jean Piaget**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/jean-piaget). It posits that people learn most effectively when they are actively involved in constructing personally meaningful artifacts, whether physical or digital. This hands-on approach emphasizes exploration, experimentation, and sharing within a community, moving beyond Piaget's focus on mental construction (**constructivism**) to include the importance of tangible creation.

The core principles involve learning by making, working on meaningful projects, creating public artifacts for sharing and discussion, and grappling with "powerful ideas" that unlock new ways of thinking.

## Learning by Making {#learning-by-making}

**Constructionism** isn't just another pedagogical theory... Developed by [**Seymour Papert**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/seymour-papert) at the **MIT Media Lab** (building upon [**Jean Piaget's**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/jean-piaget) work), its core idea is simple yet profound: **people learn best by making things.**...

This philosophy emerged from the unique, collaborative, and often openly accessible environment of the **MIT AI Lab** in its early days. The lab fostered a culture of exploration and shared learning, exemplified by practices like its historical ["Tourist Policy"](https://donhopkins.medium.com/mit-ai-lab-tourist-policy-f73b77075631), which granted many outsiders (including [**Don Hopkins**](/pages/about/don-hopkins)) access to its powerful ITS time-sharing system, contributing to a fertile ground for innovation in computing and education.

## Key Figures & Concepts

Explore the ideas of key thinkers associated with or influential to Constructionism:

*   [**Seymour Papert**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/seymour-papert): The father of Constructionism, Papert co-founded the **MIT AI Lab** with [**Marvin Minsky**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/marvin-minsky) and developed the **Logo** programming language as a tool for children to learn mathematical concepts by programming a virtual (or physical) "turtle". His book *Mindstorms* laid out the vision.
*   [**Jean Piaget**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/jean-piaget): His **constructivist** theories on the stages of cognitive development provided the foundation upon which Papert built Constructionism.
*   [**Marvin Minsky**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/marvin-minsky): AI pioneer whose work on "**The Society of Mind**" explored how intelligence could emerge from collections of simpler agents, influencing Papert's thinking about learning and computation.
*   [**Alan Kay**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/alan-kay): Visionary computer scientist whose **Dynabook** concept imagined a personal computer for children's learning. He developed **Smalltalk**, a pioneering object-oriented language, and later criticized **SimCity** as a "black box," advocating for more transparent systems.
*   [**Doreen Nelson**](/pages/about/constructionist-education/doreen-nelson): Educator who developed **Design-Based Learning**, directly applying constructionist principles in K-12 education using physical city building, and collaborated with **Maxis** on the original **SimCity Teacher's Guide**.

## The Legacy: Microworlds and Modern Tools

Papert envisioned computers facilitating the creation of "**microworlds**" – constrained yet rich digital environments where learners could explore complex ideas through direct manipulation and experimentation. [**SimCity**](/pages/about/will-wright) is often seen as a prime example, allowing players to explore urban dynamics by building cities.

This lineage continues today with visual programming languages designed for learning, such as:

*   **Logo:** The original constructionist programming language developed by Papert, using turtle graphics to make geometry and programming concepts tangible.
*   **Scratch:** Developed at the MIT Media Lab (building on Logo's legacy), Scratch uses interlocking blocks to teach programming concepts through creating interactive stories, games, and animations.
*   **Etoys:** A media-rich authoring environment based on **Squeak/Smalltalk**, heavily influenced by Papert and Kay, allowing children to build and script simulations.
*   [**Snap!**](https://snap.berkeley.edu/): A powerful, browser-based visual programming language extending Scratch's capabilities, developed at UC Berkeley. It's particularly well-suited for exploring more advanced computer science concepts.

There's significant cross-pollination within this community. Our current work on [**Micropolis**](/pages/micropolis-license) aims to integrate the simulation directly with **Snap!**, fulfilling the constructionist goal of providing powerful, understandable, and programmable microworlds for learning.
