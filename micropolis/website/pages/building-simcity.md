## Building SimCity: From Commercial Software to Open Source

[**Chaim Gingold's**](/pages/about/chaim-gingold) comprehensive book, "[**Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine**](#)" (**MIT Press**, 2024), explores the history, design, and development of **SimCity**. An important chapter in this history is the transition from proprietary software to **open source**.

This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in **SimCity**, simulation, game design, or the history of computing. It offers an unparalleled deep dive into the game's creation, context, and impact, based on years of research and interviews, including access to original source code provided by [**Don Hopkins**](/pages/about/don-hopkins). While academic in tone, it provides crucial insights valuable to developers and enthusiasts alike. Find more details on the [**Chaim Gingold** page](/pages/about/chaim-gingold#building-simcity-how-to-put-the-world-in-a-machine).

## The Open Source Journey

In 2008, **Electronic Arts** collaborated with [**Don Hopkins**](/pages/about/don-hopkins) and the **One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)** project to release the **SimCity** source code as "[**Micropolis**](/pages/micropolis-license)" under the **GPL license**. This historic release made the classic city simulation available for study, modification, and education worldwide.

The open-sourcing operates under two important licenses:

- The [**GPL License with EA's additional terms**](/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-gpl-license-notice) - protecting **EA's SimCity trademark** while allowing the code to be freely used
- The [**Micropolis Public Name License**](/pages/micropolis-license#micropolis-public-name-license) - governing the use of the "**Micropolis**" name itself

Understanding these licenses is essential for anyone working with the [**Micropolis** codebase](/pages/micropolis-license) or studying its implementation.
